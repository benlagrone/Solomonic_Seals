Then I said in my heart, that this also\nis vanity.\n16 For\nthere is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now\nis in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise\nman? as the fool.\n\n17 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all\nis vanity and vexation of spirit.\n18 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.\n19 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise\nman or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This\nis also vanity.\n20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.\n21 For there is a man whose labour\nis in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it\nfor his portion. This also\nis vanity and a great evil.\n22 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?\n23 For all his days\nare sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.\n24 There is nothing better for a man,\nthan that he should eat and drink, and\nthat he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it\nwas from the hand of God.\n\n25 For who can eat, or who else can hasten\nhereunto, more than I?\n26 For\nGod giveth to a man that\nis good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to\nhim that is good before God. This also\nis vanity and vexation of spirit.\n"

          "text": "PREFACE. \n\nIn  presenting  this  celebrated  magical  work  to  the  student  of  occult \nscience  some  few  prefatory  remarks  are  necessary. \n\nThe  Key  of  Solomon,  save  for  a curtailed  and  incomplete  copy  published \nin  France  in  the  seventeenth  century,  has  never  yet  been  printed,  but  has \nfor  centuries  remained  in  Manuscript  form  inaccessible  to  all  but  the  few \nfortunate  scholars  to  whom  the  inmost  recesses  of  the  great  libraries  were \nopen.  I therefore  consider  that  I am  highly  honoured  in  being  the  individual \nto  whose  lot  it  has  fallen  to  usher  it  into  the  light  of  day. \n\nThe  fountain-head  and  storehouse  of  Qabalistical  Magic,  and  the  origin \nof  much  of  the  Ceremonial  Magic  of  mediaeval  times,  the  “ Key”  has  been  ever \nvalued  by  occult  writers  as  a work  of  the  highest  authority ; and  notably  in \nour  own  day  Eliphaz  Levi  has  taken  it  for  the  model  on  which  his  celebrated \n“ Dogme  et  Rituel  de  la  Haute  Magie  ” was  based.  It  must  be  evident  to \nthe  initiated  reader  of  Levi,  that  the  Key  of  Solomon  was  his  text  book  of \nstudy,  and  at  the  end  of  this  volume  I give  a fragment  of  an  ancient  Hebrew \nmanuscript  of  the  “Key  of  Solomon,”  translated  and  published  in  the \n“Philosophic  Occulte,”  as  well  as  an  Invocation  called  the  “Qabalistical \nInvocation  of  Solomon,”  which  bears  close  analogy  to  one  in  the  First  Book, \nbeing  constructed  in  the  same  manner  on  the  scheme  of  the  Sephiroth. \n\nThe  history  of  the  Hebrew  original  of  the  “ Key  of  Solomon”  is  given \nin  the  Introductions,  but  there  is  every  reason  to  suppose  that  this  has  been \nentirely  lost,  and  Christian,  the  pupil  of  Levi,  says  as  much  in  his  “Histoire \nde  la  Magie.” \n\nI see  no  reason  to  doubt  the  tradition  which  assigns  the  authorship  of \nthe  “Key”  to  King  Solomon,  for  among  others  Josephus,  the  Jewish \nhistorian,  especially  mentions  the  magical  works  attributed  to  that  monarch ;\n"

          "text": "PREFACE. \n\nthis  is  confirmed  by  many  Eastern  traditions,  and  his  magical  skill  is  frequently \nmentioned  in  the  Arabian  Nights. \n\nThere  are,  however,  two  works  on  Black  Magic,  the  “ Grimorium  Verum ,” \nand  the  “ Clavicola  di  Salomone  ridolta ,”  which  have  been  attributed  to  Solomon, \nand  which  have  been  in  some  cases  especially  mixed  up  with  the  present  work ; \nbut  which  have  nothing  really  to  do  therewith ; they  are  full  of  evil  magic, \nand  I cannot  caution  the  practical  student  too  strongly  against  them. \n\nThere  is  also  another  work  called  “ Lemegeton  or  the  Lesser  Key  of \nSolomon  the  King,”  which  is  full  of  seals  of  various  Spirits,  and  is  not \nthe  same  as  the  present  book,  though  extremely  valuable  in  its  own \ndepartment. \n\nIn  editing  this  volume  I have  omitted  one  or  two  experiments  partaking \nlargely  of  Black  Magic,  and  which  had  evidently  been  derived  from  the  two \nGoetic  works  mentioned  above ; I must  further  caution  the  practical  worker \nagainst  the  use  of  blood ; the  prayer,  the  pentacle,  and  the  perfumes,  rightly \nused,  are  sufficient ; and  the  former  verges  dangerously  on  the  evil  path.  Let \nhim  who,  in  spite  of  the  warnings  of  this  volume,  determines  to  work  evil,  be \nassured  that  that  evil  will  recoil  on  himself  and  that  he  will  be  struck  by  the \nreflex  current. \n\nThis  work  is  edited  from  several  ancient  MSS.  in  the  British  Museum, \nwhich  all  differ  from  each  other  in  various  points,  some  giving  what  is  omitted \nby  the  others,  but  all  unfortunately  agreeing  in  one  thing,  which  is  the \nexecrable  mangling  of  the  Hebrew  words  through  the  ignorance  of  the \ntranscribers.  But  it  is  in  the  Pentacles  that  the  Hebrew  is  worst,  the  letters \nbeing  so  vilely  scribbled  as  to  be  actually  undecipherable  in  some  instances, \nand  it  has  been  part  of  my  work  for  several  years  to  correct  and  reinstate  the \nproper  Hebrew  and  Magical  characters  in  the  Pentacles.  The  student  may \ntherefore  safely  rely  on  their  being  now  as  nearly  correct  in  their  present \nreproduction  as  it  is  possible  for  them  to  be.  I have  therefore,  wherever  I \ncould,  corrected  the  Hebrew  of  the  Magical  Names  in  the  Conjurations  and \nPentacles ; and  in  the  few  instances  where  it  was  not  possible  to  do  so,  I have \nput  them  in  the  most  usual  form ; carefully  collating  throughout  one  MS.  with \nanother.  The  Chapters  are  a little  differently  classed  in  the  various  MSS., \nin  some  instances  the  matter  contained  in  them  being  transposed,  &amp;c.  I have \nadded  notes  wherever  necessary. \n\nThe  MSS.  from  which  this  work  is  edited  are: — Add.  MSS.,  10,862  ; \nSloane  MSS.,  1307  and  3091  ; Harleian  MSS.,  3981  ; King’s  MSS.,  288  ; \nand  Lansdowne  MSS.  1202  and  1203  ; seven  codices  in  all. \n\nOf  all  these  10,862  Add.

It  is  more  concise  in  its  wording.  Its  title  is  short,  being \nsimply  “The  Key  of  Solomon,  translated  from  the  Hebrew  language  into  the \nLatin.”  An  exact  copy  of  the  signature  of  the  writer  of  this  MS.  is  given  in \nFigure  93.

They  are  all  in  French.  The \nConjurations  and  wording  of  these  are  much  fuller  than  in  10,862  Add.  MSS. \nand  1202  Lansdowne  MSS.  The  title  is  “The  Key  of  Solomon  King  of  the \nHebrews,  translated  from  the  Hebrew  Language  into  Italian  by  Abraham \nColorno,  by  the  order  of  his  most  Serene  Highness  of  Mantua ; and  recently \nput  into  French.”  The  Pentacles  are  much  better  drawn,  are  in  coloured \ninks,  and  in  the  case  of  3091  Sloane  MSS.,  gold  and  silver  are  employed. \n\n1307  Sloane  MSS.  is  in  Italian;  its  Title  is  “La  Clavicola  di  Salomone \nRedotta  et  epilogata  nella  nostra  matema  lingua  del  dottissimo  Gio  Pecca- \ntrix.”  It  is  full  of  Black  Magic,  and  is  a jumble  of  the  Key  of  Solomon \nproper,  and  the  two  Black  Magic  books  before  mentioned.  The  Pentacles \nare  badly  drawn.  It,  however,  gives  part  of  the  Introduction  to  10,862  Add. \nMSS.,  and  is  the  only  other  MS.  which  does,  save  the  beginning  of  another \nItalian  version  which  is  bound  up  with  the  former  MS.,  and  bears  the  title \n“ Zecorbenei.” \n\n1202  Lansdowne  MSS.  is  “The  True  Keys  of  King  Solomon,  by \nArmadel.”  It  is  beautifully  written,  with  painted  initial  letters,  and  the \nPentacles  are  carefully  drawn  in  coloured  inks.  It  is  more  concise  in  style, \nbut  omits  several  Chapters.  At  the  end  are  some  short  extracts  from  the \nGrimorium  Verum  with  the  Seals  of  evil  spirits,  which,  as  they  do  not  belong \nto  the  “ Key  of  Solomon”  proper,  I have  not  given.  For  the  evident  classifi- \ncation of  the  “ Key”  is  in  two  books  and  no  more. \n\n1203  Lansdowne  MSS.  is  “The  Veritable  Keys  of  Solomon  translated \nfrom  the  Hebrew  into  the  Latin  language  by  the  Rabbin  Abognazar  (?Aben \nEzra”).  It  is  in  French,  exquisitely  written  in  printing  letters,  and  the \nPentacles  are  carefully  drawn  in  coloured  inks.

For,  on  a certain  night,  when  I laid  me  down  to  sleep, \nI called  upon  that  most  holy  Name  of  God,  I AH,  and  prayed  for  the  Ineffable \nWisdom,  and  when  I was  beginning  to  close  mine  eyes,  the  Angel  of  the \nLord,  even  Homadiel,  appeared  unto  me,  spake  many  things  courteously  unto \nme,  and  said : Listen,  O Solomon ! thy  prayer  before  the  Most  High  is  not \nin  vain,  and  since  thou  hast  asked  neither  for  long  life,  nor  for  much  riches, \nnor  for  the  souls  of  thine  enemies,  but  hast  asked  for  thyself  wisdom  to  per- \nform justice.  Thus  saith  the  Lord:  According  to  thy  word  have  I given \nunto  thee  a wise  and  understanding  heart,  so  that  before  thee  was  none  like \nunto  thee,  nor  ever  shall  arise. \n\nAnd  when  I comprehended  the  speech  which  was  made  unto  me,  I \nunderstood  that  in  me  was  the  knowledge  of  all  creatures,  both  things  which \nare  in  the  heavens  and  things  which  are  beneath  the  heavens ; and  I saw  that \nall  the  writings  and  wisdom  of  this  present  age  were  vain  and  futile,  and  that \nno  man  was  perfect.  And  I composed  a certain  work  wherein  I rehearsed \nthe  secret  of  secrets,  in  which  I have  preserved  them  hidden,  and  I have  also \ntherein  concealed  all  secrets  whatsoever  of  magical  arts  of  any  masters ; any \nsecret  or  experiments,  namely,  of  these  sciences  which  is  in  any  way  worth \nbeing  accomplished.  Also  I have  written  them  in  this  Key,  so  that  like  as  a \nkey  openeth  a treasure-house,  so  this  (Key)  alone  may  open  the  knowledge \nand  understanding  of  magical  arts  and  sciences. \n\nTherefore,  O my  son ! thou  mayest  see  every  experiment  of  mine  or  of \nothers,  and  let  everything  be  properly  prepared  for  them,  as  thou  shalt  see \nproperly  set  down  by  me,  both  day  and  hour,  and  all  things  necessary ; for \nwithout  this  there  will  be  but  falsehood  and  vanity  in  this  my  work ; wherein \nare  hidden  all  secrets  and  mysteries  which  can  be  performed ; and  that  which\n"

And  as \nSolomon  commanded,  so  was  it  done. \n\nAnd  when,  therefore  (men)  had  waited  for  a long  time,  there  came  unto \nthe  Sepulchre  certain  Babylonian  Philosophers;  and  when  they  had  assembled \nthey  at  once  took  counsel  together  that  a certain  number  of  men  should \nrenew  the  Sepulchre  in  his  (Solomon’s)  honour ; and  when  the  Sepulchre  was \ndug  out  and  repaired  the  Ivory  Casket  was  discovered,  and  therein  was  the \nKey  of  Secrets,  which  they  took  with  joyful  mind,  and  when  they  had  opened \nit  none  among  them  could  understand  it  on  account  of  the  obscurity  of  the \nwords  and  their  occult  arrangement,  and  the  hidden  character  of  the  sense \nand  knowledge,  for  they  were  not  worthy  to-  possess  this  treasure. \n\nThen,  therefore,  arose  one  among  them,  more  worthy  (than  the  others), \nboth  in  the  sight  of  the  gods,  and  by  reason  of  his  age,  who  was  called  Iohe \nGrevis,*  and  said  unto  the  others : Unless  we  shall  come  and  ask  the  interpre- \ntation from  the  Lord,  with  tears  and  entreaties,  we  shall  never  arrive  at  the \nknowledge  of  it. \n\nTherefore,  when  each  of  them  had  retired  to  his  bed,  Iohe  indeed  falling \nupon  his  face  on  the  earth,  began  to  weep,  and  striking  his  breast,  said : \n\nWhat  have  I deserved  (above  others),  seeing  that  so  many  men  can \nneither  understand  nor  interpret  this  knowledge,  even  though  there  were \nno  secret  thing  in  nature  which  the  Lord  hath  hidden  from  me  1 Wherefore \nare  these  words  so  obscure  ? Wherefore  am  I so  ignorant  ? \n\nAnd  then  on  his  bended  knees,  stretching  his  hands  to  Heaven, \nhe  said : \n\nO God,  the  Creator  of  all,  Thou  Who  knowest  all  things,  Who  gavest \nso  great  Wisdom  unto  Solomon  the  Son  of  David  the  King ; grant  unto  me, \nI beseech  Thee,  O Holy  Omnipotent  and  Ineffable  Father,  to  receive  the \nvirtue  of  that  wisdom,  so  that  I may  become  worthy  by  Thine  aid  to  attain \nunto  the  understanding  of  this  Key  of  Secrets. \n\nAnd  immediately  there  appeared  unto  me,t  the  Angel  of  the  Lord, \nsaying : \n\nDo  thou  remember  if  the  secrets  of  Solomon  appear  hidden  and  obscure \nunto  thee,  that  the  Lord  hath  wished  it,  so  that  such  wisdom  may  not  fall  into \nthe  hands  of  wicked  men ; wherefore  do  thou  promise  unto  me,  that  thou  art \nnot  willing  that  so  great  wisdom  should  ever  come  to  any  living  creature,  and \n\n* I think  this  is  correct,  but  the  name  is  very  indistinctly  written  in  the  MS.,  which  is \ndifficult  to  decipher.  In  another  copy  of  the  Clavicle  it  is  written  Iroe  Grecis,  but  I think  this \nis  an  error. \n\nf “Mihi”  in  MS.,  probably  a slip  for  “ unto  him,”  “ ei/’\n"

And  in  order  that  thou  mayest  understand  how \nI have  arrived  at  this  degree  (of  wisdom),  it  is  necessary  to  tell  thee  that  one \nday,  when  I was  meditating  upon  the  power  of  the  Supreme  Being,  the  Angel \nof  the  great  God  appeared  before  me  as  I was  saying,  O how  wonderful  are \nthe  works  of  God ! I suddenly  beheld,  at  the  end  of  a thickly-shaded  vista  of \ntrees,  a Light  in  the  form  of  a blazing  Star,  which  said  unto  me  with  a voice \nof  thunder  : Solomon,  Solomon,  be  not  dismayed  ; the  Lord  is  willing  to  satisfy \nthy  desire  by  giving  thee  knowledge  of  whatsoever  thing  is  most  pleasant  unto \nthee.  I order  thee  to  ask  of  Him  whatsoever  thou  desirest.  Whereupon, \nrecovering  from  my  surprise,  I answered  unto  the  Angel,  that  according  to \nthe  Will  of  the  Lord,  I only  desired  the  Gift  of  Wisdom,  and  by  the  Grace  of \nGod  I obtained  in  addition  the  enjoyment  of  all  the  Celestial  treasures  and  the \nknowledge  of  all  natural  things. \n\nIt  is  by  this  means,  my  Son,  that  I possess  all  the  virtues  and  riches  of \nwhich  thou  now  seest  me  in  the  enjoyment,  and  in  order  that  thou  mayest  be \nwilling  to  be  attentive  to  all  which  I am  about  to  relate  to  thee,  and  that  thou \nmayest  retain  with  care  all  that  I am  about  to  tell  thee,  I assure  thee \nthat  the  Graces  of  the  Great  God  will  be  familiar  unto  thee,  and  that  the \nCelestial  and  Terrestrial  Creatures  will  be  obedient  unto  thee,  and  a science \nwhich  only  works  by  the  strength  and  power  of  natural  things,  and  by  the \npure  Angels  which  govern  them.  Of  which  latter  I will  give  thee  the  names \nin  order,  their  exercises  and  particular  employments  to  which  they  are  destined, \ntogether  with  the  days  over  which  they  particularly  preside,  in  order  that \nthou  mayest  arrive  at  the  accomplishment  of  all,  which  thou  wilt  find  in  this \nmy  Testament.  In  all  which  I promise  thee  success,  provided  that  all  thy \nworks  only  tend  unto  the  honour  of  God,  Who  hath  given  me  the  power  to \nrule,  not  only  over  Terrestrial  but  also  over  Celestial  things,  that  is  to  say, \nover  the  Angels,  of  whom  I am  able  to  dispose  according  to  my  will,  and \nto  obtain  from  them  very  considerable  services. \n\nFirstly.  It  is  necessary  for  thee  to  understand  that  God,  having  made  all \nthings,  in  order  that  they  may  be  submitted  unto  Him,  hath  wished  to  bring \nHis  works  to  perfection,  by  making  one  which  participates  of  the  Divine  and \nof  the  Terrestrial,  that  is  to  say,  Man ; whose  body  is  gross  and  terrestrial, \nwhile  his  soul  is  spiritual  and  celestial,  unto  whom  He  hath  made  subject  the \nwhole  earth  and  its  inhabitants,  and  hath  given  unto  Him  means  by  which  He \nmay  render  the  Angels  familiar,  as  I call  those  Celestial  creatures  who  are \ndestined : some  to  regulate  the  motion  of  the  Stars,  others  to  inhabit  the\n"

If  thou  dost  not  intend \nto  use  for  a good  purpose  the  secrets  which  I here  teach  thee,  I command \nthee  rather  to  cast  this  Testament  into  the  fire,  than  to  abuse  the  power  thou \nwilt  have  of  constraining  the  Spirits,  for  I warn  thee  that  the  beneficent \nAngels,  wearied  and  fatigued  by  thine  illicit  demands,  would  to  thy  sorrow \nexecute  the  commands  of  God,  as  well  as  to  that  of  all  such  who,  with  evil \nintent,  would  abuse  those  secrets  which  He  hath  given  and  revealed  unto  me. \nThink  not,  however,  O my  Son,  that  it  would  not  be  permitted  thee  to  profit \nby  the  good  fortune  and  happiness  which  the  Divine  Spirits  can  bring  thee ; \non  the  contrary,  it  gives  them  great  pleasure  to  render  service  to  Man  for \nwhom  many  of  these  Spirits  have  great  liking  and  affinity,  God  having  destined \nthem  for  the  preservation  and  guidance  of  those  Terrestrial  things  which  are \nsubmitted  to  the  power  of  Man. \n\nThere  are  different  kinds  of  Spirits,  according  to  the  things  over  which \nthey  preside,  some  of  them  govern  the  Empyrean  Heaven,  others  the  Primum \nMobile,  others  the  First  and  Second  Crystalline,  others  the  Starry  Heaven ; \nthere  are  also  Spirits  of  the  Heaven  of  Saturn,  which  I call  Saturnites ; there \nare  Jovial,  Martial,  Solar,  Venerean,  Mercurial,  and  Lunar  Spirits ; there  are \nalso  (Spirits)  in  the  Elements  as  well  as  in  the  Heavens,  there  are  some  in  the \nFiery  Region,  others  in  the  Air,  others  in  the  Water,  and  others  upon  the \nEarth,  which  can  all  render  service  to  that  man  who  shall  have  the  good \nfortune  to  understand  their  nature,  and  to  know  how  to  attract  them. \n\nFurthermore,  I wish  to  make  thee  understand  that  God  hath  destined  to \neach  one  of  us  a Spirit,  which  watches  over  us  and  takes  care  of  our  preserva- \ntion ; these  are  called  Genii,  who  are  elementary  like  us,  and  who  are  more \nready  to  render  service  to  those  whose  temperament  is  conformed  to  the \nElement  which  these  Genii  inhabit ; for  example,  shouldest  thou  be  of  a fiery \ntemperament,  that  is  to  say  sanguine,  thy  genius  would  be  fiery  and  submitted \nto  the  Empire  of  Bael.  Besides  this,  there  are  special  times  reserved  for  the \ninvocation  of  these  Spirits,  in  the  days  and  hours  when  they  have  power  and \nabsolute  empire.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  thou  wilt  see  in  the  following  tables \nto  what  Planet  and  to  what  Angel  each  Day  and  Hour  is  submitted,  together \nwith  the  Colours  which  belong  unto  them,  the  Metals,  Herbs,  Plants,  Aquatic, \nAerial,  and  Terrestrial  Animals,  and  Incense,  which  are  proper  to  each  of  them, \nas  also  in  what  quarter  of  the  Universe  they  ask  to  be  invoked.  Neither  are \nomitted,  the  Conjurations,  Seals,  Characters,  and  Divine  Letters,  which  belong \nto  them,  by  means  of  which  we  receive  the  power  to  sympathise  with  these \nSpirits. \n\n[ 7 ]\n"

On  consulting  the  “ Table  of  the  Magical \nNames  of  the  Hours,”  &amp;c.,  he  will  find  under  the  number  1,  the  name  Beron, \nand  in  the  column  “ Tuesday,”  the  name  of  the  angel  Zamael  over  against  it \non  the  same  line,  showing  that  the  ruler  of  the  hour  is  the  Angel  Zamael,  and \nthat  its  Magical  Name  is  Beron.  Further,  on  referring  to  the  third  Table  he \nwill  see  that  Tuesday  is  under  the  rule  of  the  planet  Mars,  whose  Archangel \nis  Khamael,  Angel  Zamael,  Metal  Iron,  and  Colour  Red.  Similarly  it  will  be \nfound  that  the  hour  from  1 o to  1 1 p.m.  on  Saturday  is  the  sixth  hour  of  the \nnight,  under  the  dominion  of  the  Sun,  that  its  Magical  Name  is  Caerra,  and \nthat  the  Angel  Michael  rules  it ; while  Saturday  itself  is  under  the  dominion \nof  the  Archangel  Tzaphqiel,  of  the  Angel  Cassiel,  of  the  Planet  Saturn,  and \nthat  the  Metal  Lead  and  the  Colour  Black  are  applicable  to  it. \n\nThe  ensuing  Text  is  taken  from  the  following  MSS.,  collated  and \ncompared  with  each  other. \n\nSloane  MSS.  1307;  Sloane  MSS.  3091  ; Harleian  MSS.  3981  ; Add. \nMSS.  10862;  King’s  MSS.  288;  Lansdowne  MSS.  1202. \n\nExtracts  have  also  been  made  from  Lansdowne  MSS.  1203,  which  differs \nconsiderably  from  the  others  in  general  arrangement,  though  containing  very \nsimilar  matter. \n\nIn  cases  where  the  MSS.  varied  from  each  other  I have  taken  the  version \nwhich  seemed  most  likely  to  be  correct,  in  some  cases  mentioning  the  variant \nreadings  in  footnotes.  I have  also,  wherever  it  was  possible  to  do  so,  corrected \nthe  Hebrew  names  in  the  Incantations,  for  these  were  in  some  cases  so  marred \nas  to  be  hardly  recognisable ; e.g.  Zenard , written  for  Tzabaoth , &amp;c.\n"

The  order  of  the  Planets  is  as  follows : \nShBThAI,  Shabbathai,  Saturn ; beneath  Saturn  is  TzDC^,  Tzedeq, \nJupiter;  beneath  Jupiter  is  MADIM,  Madim,  Mars;  beneath  Mars  is \nShMSh,  Shemesh,  the  Sun;  beneath  the  Sun  is  NVGH,  Nogah,  Venus; \nbeneath  Venus  is  KVKB,  Kokav,  Mercury;  and  beneath  Mercury  is \nLBNH,  Levanah,  the  Moon,  which,  is  the  lowest  of  all  the  Planets. \n\nIt  must,  therefore,  be  understood  that  the  Planets  have  their  dominion \nover  the  day  which  approacheth  nearest  unto  the  name  which  is  given  and \nattributed  unto  them — viz.,  over  Saturday,  Saturn;  Thursday,  Jupiter; \nTuesday,  Mars;  Sunday,  the  Sun;  Friday,  Venus;  Wednesday,  Mercury; \nand  Monday,  the  Moon. \n\nThe  rule  of  the  Planets  over  each  hour  begins  from  the  dawn  at  the \nrising  of  the  Sun  on  the  day  which  take  its  name  from  such  Planet,  and  the \nPlanet  which  follows  it  in  order,  succeeds  to  the  rule  over  the  next  hour. \nThus  (on  Saturday)  Saturn  rules  the  first  hour,  Jupiter  the  Second,  Mars  the \nthird,  the  Sun  the  fourth,  Venus  the  fifth,  Mercury  the  sixth,  the  Moon  the \nseventh,  and  Saturn  returns  in  the  rule  over  the  eighth,  and  the  others  in \ntheir  turn,  the  Planets  always  keeping  the  same  relative  order. \n\nNote  that  each  experiment  or  magical  operation  should  be  performed \nunder  the  Planet,  and  usually  in  the  hour,  which  refers  to  the  same.  For \nexample : — \n\nIn  the  Days  and  Hours  of  Saturn  thou  canst  perform  experiments  to \nsummon  the  Souls  from  Hades,  but  only  of  those  who  have  died  a natural \ndeath.  Similarly  on  these  days  and  hours  thou  canst  operate  to  bring  either \ngood  or  bad  fortune  to  buildings;  to  have  familiar  Spirits  attend  thee  in \nsleep;  to  cause  good  or  ill  success  to  business,  possessions,  goods,  seeds, \n\n* This  first  paragraph  is  omitted  in  1307  Sloane  MSS.,  and  in  10862  Add.

Cancer,  Scorpio,  or  Pisces. \n\nFor  experiments  of  a peculiar  nature,  which  cannot  be  classed  under  any \ncertain  head,  the  Moon  should  be  in  an  Airy  Sign,  viz. : — Gemini,  Libra,  or \nAquarius. \n\nBut  if  these  things  seem  unto  thee  difficult  to  accomplish,  it  will  suffice \nthee  merely  to  notice  the  Moon  after  her  combustion,  or  conjunction  with  the \nSun,  especially  just  when  she*  quits  his  beams  and  appeareth  visible.  For  then \nit  is  good  to  make  all  experiments  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  any \nmatter.  That  is  why  the  time  from  the  New  unto  the  Full  Moon  is  proper \nfor  performing  any  of  the  experiments  of  which  we  have  spoken  above.  But \nin  her  decrease  or  wane  it  is  good  for  War,  Disturbance,  and  Discord.  Like- \nwise the  period  when  she  is  almost  deprived  of  light,  is  proper  for  experiments \nof  invisibility,  and  of  Death. \n\nBut  observe  inviolably  that  thou  commence  nothing  while  the  Moon  is  in \nconjunction  with  the  Sun,  seeing  that  this  is  extremely  unfortunate,  and  that \nthou  wilt  then  be  able  to  effect  nothing ; but  the  Moon  quitting  his  beams  and \nincreasing  in  Light,  thou  canst  perform  all  that  thou  desirest,  observing  never- \ntheless the  directions  in  this  Chapter. \n\nFurthermore,  if  thou  wishest  to  converse  with  Spirits  it  should  be  espe- \ncially on  the  day  of  Mercury  and  in  his  hour,  and  let  the  Moon  be  in  an  Airy \nSign,+  as  well  as  the  Sun. \n\n* i.e.  New  Moon. \n\nt In  Add.

For  I have  sinned \nbefore  Thee  by  pride,  avarice,  and  boundless  desire  of  honours  and  riches ; by \nidleness,  gluttony,  greed,  debauchery,  and  drunkenness ; because  I have \noffended  Thee  by  all  kinds  of  sins  of  the  flesh,  adulteries,  and  pollutions,  which \nI have  committed  myself,  and  consented  that  others  should  commit ; by  sacri- \nlege, thefts,  rapine,  violation,  and  homicide ; by  the  evil  use  I have  made  of \nmy  possessions,  by  my  prodigality,  by  the  sins  which  I have  committed  against \nHope  and  Charity,  by  my  evil  advice,  flatteries,  bribes,  and  the  ill  distribution \nwhich  I have  made  of  the  goods  of  which  I have  been  possessed ; by  repulsing \nand  maltreating  the  poor,  in  the  distribution  which  I have  made  of  the  goods \ncommitted  to  my  charge,  by  afflicting  those  over  whom  I have  been  set  in \nauthority,  by  not  visiting  the  prisoners,  by  depriving  the  dead  of  burial,  by \nnot  receiving  the  poor,  by  neither  feeding  the  hungry  nor  giving  drink  to  the \nthirsty,  by  never  keeping  the  Sabbath  and  the  other  feasts,  by  not  living  chastely \nand  piously  on  those  days,  by  the  easy  consent  which  I have  given  to  those \nwho  incited  me  to  evil  deeds,  by  injuring  instead  of  aiding  those  who  demanded \nhelp  from  me,  by  refusing  to  give  ear  unto  the  cry  of  the  poor,  by  not \nrespecting  the  aged,  by  not  keeping  my  word,  by  disobedience  to  my  parents, \nby  ingratitude  towards  those  from  whom  I have  received  kindness,  by  indul- \ngence in  sensual  pleasures,  by  irreverend  behaviour  in  the  Temple  of  God,  by \nunseemly  gestures  thereat,  by  entering  therein  without  reverence,  by  vain  and \nunprofitable  discourse  when  there,  by  despising  the  sacred  vessels  of  the \ntemple,  by  turning  the  holy  Ceremonies  into  ridicule,  by  touching  and  eating \nthe  sacred  bread  with  impure  lips  and  with  profane  hands,  and  by  the  neglect \nof  my  prayers  and  adorations. \n\n1 detest  also  the  crimes  which  I have  committed  by  evil  thoughts,  vain \nand  impure  meditations,  false  suspicions,  and  rash  judgments ; by  the  evil \nconsent  which  I have  readily  given  unto  the  advice  of  the  wicked,  by  lust  of \nimpure  and  sensual  pleasures ; by  my  idle  words,  my  lies,  and  my  deceit ; by \nmy  false  vows  in  various-  ways ; and  by  my  continual  slander  and  calumny. \n\nI detest  also  the  crimes  which  1 have  committed  within ; the  treachery \nand  discord  which  I have  incited  ; my  curiosity,  greed,  false  speaking,  violence, \nmalediction,  murmurs,  blasphemies,  vain  words,  insults,  dissimulations ; my \nsins  against  God  by  the  transgression  of  the  ten  commandments,  by  neglect  of \nmy  duties  and  obligations,  and  by  want  of  love  towards  God  and  towards  my \nneighbour.\n"

Knowledge,  and  use  of  Pentacles. \n\nHe  then  who  shall  wish  to  perform  any  operation  by  the  means  of  the \nMedals,  or  Pentacles.  and  therein  to  render  himself  expert,  must  observe \nwhat  hath  been  hereinbefore  ordained.  Let  him  then,  O my  Son  Roboam, \nknow  and  understand  that  in  the  aforesaid  Pentacles  he  shall  find  those \nIneffable  and  Most  Holy  Names  which  were  written  by  the  finger  of  God  in \nthe  Tablets  of  Moses;  and  which  I,  Solomon,  have  received  through  the \nMinistry  of  an  Angel  by  Divine  Revelation.  These  then  have  I collected \ntogether,  arranged,  consecrated,  and  kept,  for  the  benefit  of  the  human  race, \nand  the  preservation  of  Body  and  of  Soul. \n\nThe  Pentacles  should  then  be  made  in  the  days  and  hours  of  Mercury, \nwhen  the  Moon  is  in  an  aerial*  or  terrestrial  sign  ; she  should  also  be  in  her \nincrease,  and  in  equal  number  of  days  with  the  Sun. \n\nIt  is  necessary  to  have  a Chamber  or  Cabinet  specially  set  apart  and \nnewly  cleaned,  wherein  thou  canst  remain  without  interruption,  the  which \nhaving  entered  with  thy  Companions,  thou  shalt  incense  and  perfume  it  with \nthe  odours  and  perfumes  of  the  Art.

Among  other  things,  thou  shalt  chiefly  use  these  colours : \nGold,  Cinnabar  or  Vermilion  Red,  and  celestial  or  brilliant  Azure  Blue. \nFurthermore,  thou  shalt  make  these  Medals  or  Pentacles  with  exorcised  pen \nand  colours,  as  we  shall  hereafter  show  thee.  Whensoever  thou  constructest \nthem,  if  thou  canst  complete  them  in  the  hour  wherein  thou  didst  begin  them, \nit  is  better.  However,  if  it  be  absolutely  necessary  to  interrupt  the  work, \nthou  shouldest  await  the  proper  day  and  hour  before  re-commencing  it. \n\nThe  Pentacles  being  finished  and  completed,  take  a cloth  of  very  fine \nsilk,  as  we  shall  hereafter  ordain  thee,  in  the  which  thou  shalt  wrap  the \nPentacles.

Thus,  after  having  taught  thee  all  the \nCeremonies  which  concern  the  manner  of  performing  the  Operations,  I am  at \nlength  determined  to  make  thee  a partaker  in  the  secrets  of  which  I have \nparticular  knowledge,  unknown  to  this  day  unto  the  generality  of  men ; but, \nnevertheless,  only  on  the  condition  that  thou  attemptest  not  the  ruin  and \ndestruction  of  thy  neighbour,  for  his  blood  will  cry  for  vengeance  unto  God, \nand  in  the  end  thou  and  thine  shall  feel  the  just  wrath  of  an  offended  Deity. \nHowever,  God  not  having  forbidden  honest  and  lawful  pleasures,  thou  mayest \nperform  boldly  the  Operations  which  follow,  it  being  always  especially \nnecessary  to  distinguish  between  the  good  and  the  evil,  so  as  to  choose  the \nformer  and  avoid  the  latter,  which  is  why  I command  thee  to  be  attentive  to \nall  that  is  contained  in  this  my  Testament. \n\nFrom  here  to  the  end  of  the  Chapter  is  only  given  in  Lansdowne  MSS.  1203. \nf i.e.  When  the  Sun  is  in  the  Sign  Leo.\n"

They  should  be  engraved  with  the  instrument  of  Art  in \nthe  days  and  hours  proper  to  the  Planet. \n\nSaturn  ruleth  over  Lead;  Jupiter  over  Tin;  Mars  over  Iron;  the  Sun \nover  Gold  ; Venus  over  Copper  ; Mercury  over  the  mixture  of  Metals  ; and \nthe  Moon  over  Silver. \n\nThey  may  also  be  made  with  exorcised  Virgin  paper,  writing  thereon \nwith  the  colours  adopted  for  each  Planet,  referring  to  the  rules  already \nlaid  down  in  the  proper  Chapters,  and  according  to  the  Planet  with  which  the \nPentacle  is  in  sympathy. \n\nWherefore  unto  Saturn  the  colour  of  Black  is  appropriated ; Jupiter \nruleth  over  Celestial  Blue ; Mars  over  Red  ; the  Sun  over  Gold,  or  the  colour \nof  Yellow  or  Citron;  Venus  over  Green;  Mercury  over  Mixed  Colours  ; the \nMoon  over  Silver,  or  the  colour  of  Argentine  Earth. \n\nThe  Matter  of  which  the  Pentacle  is  constructed  should  be  Virgin, \nnever  having  been  used  for  any  other  purpose ; or  if  it  be  metal  it  should  be \npurified  by  fire. \n\nAs  regards  the  size  of  the  Pentacles  it  is  arbitrary,  so  long  as  they  are \nmade  according  to  the  rules,  and  with  the  requisite  solemnities,  as  hath  been \nordained. \n\nThe*  virtues  of  the  Holy  Pentacles  are  no  less  advantageous  unto  thee \nthan  the  knowledge  of  the  secrets  which  I have  already  given  unto  thee ; and \n\nThis  and  the  four  following  paragraphs  are  from  1203  Lansdowne  MSS.\n"

The  versicle  is  from  Canticles  viii.  6 : — “ Place \nme  as  a signet  upon  thine  heart,  as  a signet  upon  thine  arm,  for  love  is  strong \nas  death.” \n\nFigure  41. — The  Third  Pentacle  of  Venus. — This,  if  it  be  only  shown \nunto  any  person,  serveth  to  attract  love.

Be  ye  fruitful,  and  multiply,  and  replenish  the  earth, \nand  subdue  it.” \n\nFigure  42. — The  Fourth  Pentacle  of  Venus. — It  is  of  great  power,  since \nit  compels  the  Spirits  of  Venus  to  obey,  and  to  force  on  the  instant  any \nperson  thou  wishest  to  come  unto  thee. \n\nEditor's  Note. — At  the  four  Angles  of  the  Figure  are  the  four  letters  of \nthe  Name  IHVH.  The  other  letters  form  the  Names  of  Spirits  of  Venus, \ne.g. : — Schii,  Eli,  Ayib,  &amp;c.  The  versicle  is  from  Genesis  ii.  23,  24 : — \n“ This  is  bone  of  my  bones,  and  flesh  of  my  flesh.  And  they  two  were  one \nflesh.” \n\nFigure  43. — The  Fifth  and  last  Pentacle  of  Venus. — When  it  is  only \nshowed  unto  any  person  soever,  it  inciteth  and  exciteth  wonderfully  unto  love. \n\nj Editor's  Note. — Around  the  central  Square  are  the  Names  Elohim,  El  Gebil \nand  two  other  Names  which  I cannot  decipher,  and  have,  therefore,  given \nthem  as  they  stand.  The  characters  are  those  of  the  “ Passing  of  the  River.” \nThe  surrounding  versicle  is  from  Psalm  xxii.  14  : — “My  heart  is  like  wax,  it \nis  melted  in  the  midst  of  my  bowels.”\n"

But  when  neither  hour  nor  time  of \noperation  or  invocation  is  specified,  it  is  then  much  better  to  perform  these \nexperiments  at  night,  seeing  that  it  is  more  easy  to  the  Spirits  to  appear  in  the \npeaceful  silence  of  night  than  during  the  day.  And  thou  shouldest  inviolably \nobserve,  that  wishing  to  invoke  the  Spirits,  either  by  day  or  by  night,  it  is \nnecessary  that  it  should  be  done  in  a place  hidden,  removed,  secret,  convenient, \nand  proper  for  such  Art,  where  no  man  frequenteth  or  inhabiteth,  as  we  shall \nrelate  more  fully  in  its  place. \n\nIf  then  thou  shouldest  operate  touching  anything  which  hath  been  stolen, \nin  whatever  way  it  be  performed  and  whatever  way  it  may  have  been  prepared, \nit  is  necessary  to  practise  it  on  the  days  and  hours  of  the  Moon,  being  if \npossible  in  her  increase,  and  from  the  first  unto  the  eighth  hour  of  the  day. \n\nBut  if  it  be  by  night,  then  it  should  be  at  the  fifth  or  at  the  third  hour; \nbut  it  is  better  by  day  than  by  the  night,  for  the  light  justifieth  them,  and \nmaketh  them  much  more  fit  for  publication. \n\nBut  if  the  Operations  be  regarding  Invisibility,  they  should  be  put  in \npractice  at  the  first,  second,  and  third  hour  of  Mars  by  day.  But  if  by  night, \nuntil  the  third  hour. \n\nIf  they  be  Operations  of  seeking  love,  grace,  or  favour,  they  should  be \nperformed  until  the  eighth  hour  of  the  same  day,  commencing  with  the  first \nhour  of  the  Sun;  and  from  the  first  hour  of  Venus  unto  the  first  hour  of  the \nsame  day  of  Venus. \n\n* In  10862  Add.  MSS.  it  says  “the  second.”\n"

But  as  regards  beginners,  they  should  always  have  the  days \nand  hours  well  disposed  and  appropriate  unto  the  Art.  And  the  Wise  should \nonly  observe  the  precepts  of  the  Art  which  are  necessary,  and  in  observing  the \nother  solemnities  necessary  they  will  operate  with  a perfect  assurance. \n\nIt  is,  nevertheless,  necessary  to  take  care  that  when  thou  shalt  have \nprepared  any  experiment  thyself  for  the  days  and  hours  ordained,  that  it \nshould  be  performed  in  clear,  serene,  mild,  and  pleasant  weather,  without  any \ngreat  tempest  or  agitation  of  the  air,  which  should  not  be  troubled  by  winds. \nFor  when  thou  shalt  have  conjured  any  Spirits  in  any  art  or  experiment,  they \nwill  not  come  when  the  Air  is  troubled  or  agitated  by  winds,  seeing  that \nSpirits  have  neither  flesh  nor  bones,  and  are  created  of  different  substances. \n\nSome  are  created  from  Water. \n\nOthers  from  Wind,  unto  which  they  are  like. \n\nSome  from  Earth. \n\nSome  from  Clouds. \n\nOthers  from  Solar  Vapours. \n\nOthers  from  the  keenness  and  strength  of  Fire ; and  when  they  are \ninvoked  or  summoned,  they  come  always  with  great  noise,  and  with  the \nterrible  nature  of  fire. \n\nWhen  the  Spirits  which  are  created  of  Water  are  invoked,  they  come \nwith  great  rains,  thunder,  hail,  lightning,  thunder-bolts,  and  the  like. \n\nr\n"

This  is  the  reason  why  in  every \nOperation  whose  Experience  should  be  carried  out  in  the  Circle,  it  is  well  to \nhave  three  Companions.  And  if  he  cannot  have  Companions,  he  should  at \nleast  have  with  him  a faithful  and  attached  dog.

Amen. \n\nAfter  this  let  the  Disciples  robe  themselves  as  the  Master  hath  done,  and \nfast  like  him  for  three  days,  repeating  the  same  prayer ; let  them  act  like  him, \nand  in  the  work  let  them  implicitly  follow  and  obey  him  in  all  things. \n\nBut  if  the  Master  of  the  Art  wisheth  to  have  a dog  for  his  Companion, \nhe  must  bathe  him  thoroughly  with  the  exorcised  water  in  the  same  manner  as \nthe  Disciples,  and  let  him  perfume  him  with  the  odours  and  incense  of  Art, \nand  let  him  repeat  the  following  Conjuration  over  him : — \n\nI conjure  thee,  O thou  Creature,  being  a Dog,  by  Him  Who  hath  created \nthee,  I bathe  and  I perfume  thee  in  the  Name  of  the  Most  High,  Most \nPowerful,  and  Eternal  God,  so  that  thou  mayest  be  my  true  Companion  in \nthis  operation,  and  that  thou  mayest  be  also  my  faithful  friend  in  whatsoever \nOperation  I may  hereafter  perform.\n"

These  shoes  should  be  made \nduring  the  days  of  fast  and  abstinence,  namely,  during  the  nine  days  set \napart  before  the  beginning  of  the  Operation,  during  which  the  necessary \ninstruments  also  should  be  prepared,  polished,  brightened,  and  cleaned. \n\nBesides  this,  the  Master  of  the  Art  should  have  a Crown  made  of  Virgin \npaper,  upon  the  which  should  be  written  these  four  Names : — Yod,  He,  Vau, \nHe,  in  front;  Adonai  behind ; El  on  the  right ; and  Elohim  on  the  left.  ( See \nFigure  57.)  These  Names  should  be  written  with  the  ink  and  pen  of  the  Art, \nwhereof  we  shall  speak  in  the  proper  Chapter.  The  Disciples  should  also \neach  have  a Crown  of  Virgin  paper  whereon  these  Divine  symbols  should  be \nmarked  in  scarlet.  {See  Figure  58.) \n\nTake  heed  also  that  in  clothing  thyself  with  these  aforesaid  habiliments, \nthat  thou  recite  these  Psalms : — Psalms  xv. ; cxxxi. ; cxxxvii. ; cxvii. ; lxvii. ; \nlxviii. ; and  cxxvii. \n\nAfter  this  perfume  the  vestments  with  the  perfumes  and  suffumigations \nof  the  Art,  and  sprinkle  them  with  the  water  and  hyssop  of  the  Art. \n\nBut  when  the  Master  and  His  Disciples  shall  commence  to  robe  them- \nselves after  the  first  Psalm,  and  before  continuing  with  the  others,  he  should \npronounce  these  words : — \n\nAmor,  Amator,  Amides,  Ideodaniach,  Pamor,  Plaior,  Anitor; \nthrough  the  merits  of  these  holy  Angels  will  I robe  and  indue  myself  with  the \nVestments  of  Power,  through  which  may  I conduct  unto  the  desired  end  those \nthings  which  I ardently  wish,  through  Thee,  O Most  Holy  Adonai,  Whose \nKingdom  and  Empire  endureth  for  ever.  Amen. \n\nTake  notice  that  if  the  linen  garments  were  vestments  of  the  Levites  or \nof  the  Priests,  and  had  been  used  for  holy  things,  that  they  would  be  all  the \nbetter.\n"

Wherefore  desolate  and  uninhabited  regions  are  most \nappropriate,  such  as  the  borders  of  lakes,  forests,  dark  and  obscure  places,  old \nand  deserted  houses,  whither  rarely  and  scarce  ever  men  do  come,  mountains, \ncaves,  caverns,  grottos,  gardens,  orchards ; but  best  of  all  are  cross-roads,  and \nwhere  four  roads  meet,  during  the  depth  and  silence  of  night.  But  if  thou \ncanst  not  conveniently  go  unto  any  of  these  places,  thy  house,  and  even  thine \nown  chamber,  or,  indeed,  any  place,  provided  it  hath  been  purified  and  conse- \ncrated with  the  necessary  ceremonies,  will  be  found  fit  and  convenient  for  the \nconvocation  and  assembling  of  the  Spirits. \n\nThese  Arts  or  Operations  should  be  carried  out  at  the  prescribed  time, \nbut  if  there  be  no  time  specially  appointed  it  will  be  always  better  to  perform \nthem  at  night,  which  is  the  most  fit  and  proper  time  for  the  Operations  of \nNecromancy ; this  is  also  a symbol  that  it  is  just  and  right  to  hide  them  from \nthe  sight  of  the  foolish,  the  ignorant,  and  the  profane. \n\nBut  when  thou  shalt  have  selected  a place  fitting,  thou  mayest  perform \nthine  experiments  by  day  or  by  night.  It  should  be  spacious,  clear,  and \nbounded  on  all  sides  by  hedges,  shrubs,  trees,  or  walls.  Thou  shalt  thyself \ncleanse  it  thoroughly  and  render  it  neat  and  pure,  and  while  doing  this  thou \nshalt  recite  Psalms  ii. ; Ixvii. ; and  liv. \n\nAfter  this  thou  shalt  perfume  it  with  the  odours  and  suffumigations  of  the \nArt,  and  shalt  sprinkle  it  with  the  water  and  the  hyssop ; and  after  this  thou \nmayest  in  this  place  make  all  the  necessary  preparations  for  an  operation. \n\nBut  when,  later  on,  thou  shalt  go  unto  this  place,  to  complete  and \naccomplish  the  operation,  thou  shalt  repeat  on  the  way  thither  the  following \nPrayer  in  a low  and  distinct  voice : — \n\nThe  Prayer. \n\nZazaii,  Zamaii,  Puidamon  Most  Powerful,  Sedon  Most  Strong,  El, \nYod  He  Vau  He,  Iah,  Agla,  assist  me  an  unworthy  sinner  who  have  had \nthe  boldness  to  pronounce  these  Holy  Names  which  no  man  should  name  and \ninvoke  save  in  very  great  danger.  Therefore  have  I recourse  unto  these  Most \nHoly  Names,  being  in  great  peril  both  of  soul  and  of  body.  Pardon  me  if  I \nhave  sinned  in  any  manner,  for  I trust  in  Thy  protection  alone,  especially  on \nthis  journey. \n\nLet  the  Master  as  he  goeth  sprinkle  the  path  with  the  water  and  hyssop\n"

( See  Figure  84.) \n\nAfter  this  thou  shalt  repeat  over  the  Candles,  Psalms  cli. ; ciii. ; cvii., \nand  shalt  say: — \n\n0 Lord  God,  Who  governest  all  things  by  Thine  Almighty  Power,  give \nunto  me,  a poor  sinner,  understanding  and  knowledge  to  do  only  that  which \nis  agreeable  unto  Thee ; grant  unto  me  to  fear,  adore,  love,  praise,  and  give \nthanks  unto  Thee  with  true  and  sincere  faith  and  perfect  charity.  Grant,  O \nLord,  before  I die,  and  descend  into  the  realms  beneath,  and  before  the  fiery \nflame  shall  devour  me,  that  Thy  Grace  may  not  leave  me,  O Lord  of  my \nSoul.  Amen. \n\nAfter  this  thou  shalt  add : — \n\n1 exorcise  thee,  O Creature  of  wax,  by  Him  Who  alone  hath  created  all \nthings  by  His  Word,  and  by  the  virtue  of  Him  Who  is  pure  truth,  that  thou \ncast  out  from  thee  every  Phantasm,  Perversion,  and  Deceit  of  the  Enemy,  and \nmay  the  Virtue  and  Power  of  God  enter  into  thee,  so  that  thou  mayest  give \nus  light,  and  chase  far  from  us  all  fear  or  terror. \n\nAfter  this  thou  shalt  sprinkle  them  with  the  Water  of  the  Art,  and \nincense  them  with  the  usual  perfumes. \n\nAnd  when  thou  shalt  wish  to  kindle  them  thou  shalt  say : — \n\nI exorcise  thee,  O Creature  of  Fire,  in  the  Name  of  the  Sovereign  and \nEternal  Lord,  by  His  Ineffable  Name,  which  is  Yod,  He,  Vau,  He;  by  the \nName  I ah;  and  by  the  Name  of  Power  El  ; that  thou  mayest  enlighten  the \nheart  of  all  the  Spirits  which  we  shall  call  unto  this  Circle,  so  that  they  may \nappear  before  us  without  fraud  and  deceit  through  Him  Who  hath  created  all \nthings. \n\nThen  thou  shalt  take  a square  Lantern,  with  panes  of  Crystal  glass,  and \nthou  shalt  fit  therein  the  Candle  lighted,  to  read  by,  to  form  the  Circle,  or  any \nother  purpose  for  which  thou  shalt  require  it.\n"

Sometimes  white  animals  are  sacrificed  to \nthe  good  Spirits  and  black  to  the  evil.  Such  sacrifices  consist  of  the  blood \nand  sometimes  of  the  flesh. \n\nThey  who  sacrifice  animals,  of  whatsoever  kind  they  be,  should  select \nthose  which  are  virgin,  as  being  more  agreeable  unto  the  Spirits,  and  rendering \nthem  more  obedient. \n\nWhen  blood  is  to  be  sacrificed  it  should  be  drawn  also  from  virgin \nquadrupeds  or  birds,  but  before  offering  the  oblation,  say  : — \n\nMay  this  Sacrifice  which  we  find  it  proper  to  offer  unto  ye,  noble  and \nlofty  Beings,  be  agreeable  and  pleasing  unto  your  desires;  be  ye  ready  to \nobey  us,  and  ye  shall  receive  greater  ones. \n\nThen  perfume  and  sprinkle  it  according  to  the  rules  of  Art. \n\nWhen  it  is  necessary,  with  all  the  proper  Ceremonies,  to  make  Sacrifices \nof  fire,  they  should  be  made  of  wood  which  hath  some  quality  referring \nespecially  unto  the  Spirits  invoked;  as  juniper  of  pine  unto  the  Spirits  of \nSaturn ; box,  or  oak,  unto  those  of  Jupiter;  cornel,  or  cedar,  unto  those  of \nMars  ; laurel  unto  those  of  the  Sun ; myrtle  unto  those  of  V enus  ; hazel  unto \nthose  of  Mercury  ; and  willow  unto  those  of  the  Moon. \n\nBut  when  we  make  sacrifices  of  food  and  drink,  everything  necessary \nshould  be  prepared  without  the  circle,  and  the  meats  should  be  covered  with \nsome  fine  clean  cloth,  and  have  also  a clean  white  cloth  spread  beneath  them ; \nwith  new  bread  and  good  and  sparkling  wine,  but  in  all  things  those  which \nrefer  to  the  nature  of  the  Planet.  Animals,  such  as  fowls  or  pigeons,  should \nbe  roasted.  Especially  shouldest  thou  have  a vessel  of  clear  and  pure  fountain \nwater,  and  before  tlipu  enterest  into  the  Circle,  thou  shaft  summon  the  Spirits \nby  their  proper  Names,  or  at  least  those  chief  among  them,  saying: — \n\nIn  whatsoever  place  ye  may  be,  ye  Spirits,  who  are  invited  to  this  feast, \ncome  ye  and  be  ready  to  receive  our  offerings,  presents,  and  sacrifices,  and  ye \nshall  have  hereafter  yet  more  agreeable  oblations. \n\nPerfume  the  viands  with  sweet  incense,  and  sprinkle  them  with  exorcised \nwater ; then  commence  to  conjure  the  Spirits  until  they  shall  come. \n\nThis  is  the  manner  of  making  sacrifices  in  all  arts  and  operations  wherein \nit  is  necessary,  and  acting  thus,  the  Spirits  will  be  prompt  to  serve  thee.\n"

Turner translates a Latin \nversion published by Agrippa fifty years earlier. While many earlier Latin versions \nare referenced by scholars - some from as early as the 13th century - no one has as yet \ntaken the time to produce an updated English rendition of the work, or to fully com- \npare Agrippa's version with the earlier versions. \n\nThe foundation and essence of the practices described in the Ars Notoria lies in \nthe figures or \"notes\" that give it its title. These consist partly of realistic illustrations, \npartly of sigils and signs similar to other grimoires of the day, and partly of text, \nwhich winds into and around the graphical elements. When used as objects of \ncontemplation (or in a more active use of visual imagination) the notes are said to \nplace the user's mind in a state in which it is granted complete knowledge or skill in \none of the seven Liberal Arts. Unfortunately, Turner's translation did not include \nthese figures. \n\nPhotographs of several notes can be found in Visual Art in Two Manuscripts of \nthe Ars Notoria, by Michael Camille, published in Conjuring Spirits: Texts and Tradi- \ntions of Medieval Ritual Magic, edited by Claire Fanger, published by the Pennsylva- \nnia State University Press. According to Dr. Fanger, there are at least three \nstylistically distinct sets of notes to be found among the Latin manuscripts of the \nNotoria. No one set is considered definitive. \n\nThe text instructs the practioner to \"look into\" or \"inspect\" the note with which \nhe is working several times a day, and to recite certain prayers and magickal names \nduring a portion of those occasions. The specific prayers and names are integrated \ninto the visual portion of the note in some instances, and it is not known whether \nthese integrated prayers are among the many translated by Turner. \n\nWhat is actually meant by \"inspect\" is obscure. The Latin word, inspicio, has \nessentially the same range of meanings as the modern English word; none of them \nare informative in the context. But the text mentions several times that visions are a\n"

          "text": "section quoted below suggests that something more than close examination is \nintended. \n\nAnd know this; that if thou hast not the books in thy hands, or the faculty of \nlooking into them is not given to thee; the effeft of this work will not be the \nlesse therefore: but the Orations are twice then to be pronounced, where \nthey were to be but once: And as to the knowledge of a vision, and the other \nvirtues which these Holy Orations have; thou maist prove and try them, \nwhen and how thou wilt. \n\nSo it would seem that a specific skill or ability is involved, a \"faculty of inspec- \ntion\". Perhaps this was simply the ability to memorize the image and visualize it \n\nwhile reciting the orations. The monk John of Morigny, who practiced the Ars Noto- \nria to some effect, later used such visualization in his own system of religious magic. \nSuch techniques were generally known at the time, from various systems for improv- \ning the memory. Or possibly the technique was similar to those used by modern \nmagicians to obtain a vision related to a specific symbol, by using it as a \"gate\" in the \nimagination, and entering into an astral world that embodies the meaning of the \nsymbol. In any case, the author of the Notoria seems confident that one can get by \nwithout such skill if necessary; the Prayers alone, said with sufficient fervor and rep- \netition, will produce the same results. \n\nThe book is divided into three sections. The first of these deals with what the \nauthor calls \"generals\"; these are abilities of broad application - memory, eloquence, \nunderstanding and perseverance - which need to be developed before the practitioner \nworks to obtain the particular skills of one of the Liberal Arts. These latter he refers \nto as the \"specials\". The section mixes commentary with prayers that are to be used to \nobtain the abilities, in a manner that is somewhat difficult to follow. (It should be \nnoted that only an abbreviated form of some prayers is given. ) \n\nThe second section deals with the \"specials\", giving prayers in sequence for each \nof the Liberal Arts, in the order in which they were customarily taught. The Notes \nall relate to this section of the book; each prayer is accompanied by instructions on \nthe use of the proper note, and some small amount of commentary. \n\nThe third section presents some prayers that were allegedly given to Solomon at \na different time than those of the previous sections. However, most of these prayers \nare those already referenced in Part I, save that they are given here in full. The focus \nof this section is again on the \"generals\", though the technique described varies in \nsome respect from those previously given. Dr. Fanger and others have speculated that \nthis section was a variant of Part I, which perhaps had originally been circulated sep- \narately, and later incorporated in the Ars Notoria for its greater detail. \n\nNone of these sections are clearly distinguished in the text, which can lead to a \ngreat deal of confusion as instructions in one section seem to conflict with those in \nanother. The start of each section has therefore been marked by a footnote. \n\nThe text of this edition was transcribed directly from a photocopy of Turner's \nfirst edition, published in 1657. Even by the standards of the time, the book was not a \ngreat example of the typographer's art; it was cheaply printed, and was clearly typeset \nby three different people, each with their own notions of what constituted good text \nlayout, and of what constituted proper spelling of English. For the overall layout of \nthis edition, I have selected elements from each of their styles, but use them consis- \ntently throughout the text. The punctuation, and the spelling, capitalization and \nemphasis of individual words have been left as in the original. The exception is that I \nhave not followed the 17th-century practice of substituting the letter \"f ' for \"s\", \nbelieving that doing so would greatly reduce the readability of the text.

Oh Almighty God, the Beginning of all things, without \nBeginning, and without End: Graciously this day hear my Prayers; neither do thou \nrender unto me according to my sins, nor after mine iniquities, O Lord my God, but \naccording to thy mercy, which is greater then all things visible and invisible. Have \nmercy upon me, O Christ, the Wisdom of the Father, The Light of the Angels, The \nGlory of the Saints, The Hope, Refuge, and Support of Sinners, The Creator of all \nthings, and Redeemer of all humane Frailties, who holdest the Heaven, Earth, and \nSea, and all the whole World, in the palm of thy Hand: I humbly implore and \nbeseech, that thou wilt mercifully with the Father, illustrate my Minde with the \nbeams of thy holy Spirit, that I may be able to come and attain to the perfection of \nthis most holy Art; and that I may be able to gain the knowledge of every Science, \nArt, and Wisdom; and of every Faculty of Memory, Intelligences, Understanding, \nand Intellect, by the Vertue and Power of thy most holy Spirit, and in thy Name. \nAnd thou, O God my God, who in the Beginning hast created the Heaven and the \nEarth, and all things out of nothing; who reformest, and makest all things by thy \nown Spirit; compleat, fulfil, restore, and implant a sound understanding in me, that I \nmay glorify thee and all thy Works, in all my Thoughts, Words, and Deeds. O God \nthe Father, confirm and grant this my Prayer, and increase my Understanding and \nMemory, and strengthen the same, to know and receive the Science, Memory, Elo- \nquence, and Perseverance in all manner of Learning, who livest and reignest, World \nwithout end. zAmen. \n\nc liere beginneth the first Treatise of this cArt, which (^Master cApollonius calleth, The \nGolden Flowers, being the general! 'Introduction to all the Statural Sciences; and this is \nQonfrmed, Qomposed, and ^Approved by the Authority o/^Solomon, Manichaeus, and \n\nEuduchaeus. \n\nI, cApollonius, Master of Arts, duly called, to whom the Nature of Liberal Arts hath \nbeen granted, am intended to treat of the Knowledge of Liberal Arts, and of the \nKnowledge of Astronomy; and with what Experiments and Documents, a Compen- \ndious and Competent Knowledge of Arts may be attained unto; and how the highest \nand lowest Mysteries of Nature may be competently divided, and fitted and applied \nto the Natures of Times; and what proper dayes and hours are to be elefted for the \nDeeds and Actions of men, to be begun and ended; what Qualifications a man ought \nto have, to attain the Efficacy of this Art; and how he ought to dispose of the actions \nof his life, and to behold and study the Course of the Moon. In the first place there- \nfore, we shall declare certain Precepts of the Spiritual Sciences; that all things which \nwe intend to speak of, may be attained to in order. Wonder not therefore, at what you \nshall hear and see in this subsequent Treatise, and that you shall find an Example of \nsuch inestimable Learning. \n\nSome things which follow, which we will deliver to thee as Essayes of wonderful \nEffefts, and have extracted them out of the most Ancient Books of the Hebrews; \nwhich, where thou seest them, (although they are forgotten, and worn out of any \nhumane Language) nevertheless esteem them as Miracles: For I do truly admire the \ngreat Power and Efficacy of Words in the Works of Nature. \n\nOf what Efficacy Words are. \n\nThere is so great Virtue, Power and Efficacy in certain Names and Words of God, \nthat when you read those very Words, it shall immediately increase and help your \nEloquence, so that you shall be made Eloquent of Speech by them, and at length \nattain to the Effefts of the powerful Sacred Names of God; but from whence the \npower hereof doth proceed, shall be fully demonstrated to you in the following \nChapters of Prayers: And those which follow next to our hand, we shall lay it open. \n\ncAn Explanation of the Rotary zArt. \n\nThis Art is divided into two parts: the first containeth general Rules, the second spe- \ncial Rules. We come first to the special Rules, that is, First, to a threefold, and then \nto a fourfold Division: And in the third place we come to speak of Theologie; which \nSciences thou shalt attain to, by the Operations of these Orations, if thou pronounce \nthem as it is written: therefore there are certain Notes of the Notary Art, which are \nmanifest to us; the Virtue whereof Humane Reason cannot apprehend. The first \nNote hath his signification taken from the Hebrew; which though the expression \nthereof be comprehended in a very few words; nevertheless, in the expression of the \nMystery, they do not lose their Vertue: That may be called their Vertue, which doth \nhappen and proceed from their pronunciation, which ought to be greatly admired at. \n\nThe first T'recept. \n\nIriely, Scemath Amazaz, Hemel, Sathusteon, hheli Tamazam, &amp;cet. which Solomon enti- \ntled, His First Revelation; and that to be without any Interpretation: It being a Sci- \nence of so Transcendent a purity, that it hath its Original out of the depth and \nprofundity of the Chaldee, Hebrew, and Grecian Languages; and therefore cannot \npossible by any means be explicated fully in the poor Thread-bare Scheme of our \nLanguage. And of what nature the Efficacy of the aforesaid words are, Solomon him- \nself doth describe in his Eleventh Book, Helisoe, of the Mighty Glory of the Creator: \nBut the Friend and Successor of Solomon, that is, Apollonius, with some few others, to \nwhom that Science hath been manifested, have explained the same, and defined it to \nbe most Holy, Divine, Deep, and Profound Mysteries; and not to be disclosed nor \npronounced, without great Faith and reverence. \n\nzA spiritual iJVlandate of the precedent Oration. \n\nBefore any one is to reade or pronounce any Orations of this Art, to bring them to \nEffect, let them always first reverently and devoutly rehearse the Prayer in the begin- \nning. \n\nIf any one will search the Scriptures, or would understand, or eloquently pro- \nnounce any part of Scripture, let him pronounce the words of the following Figure, \nto wit, Hely Scemath, in the morning betimes of that day, wherein thou wilt begin any \nwork. And in the Name of the Lord our God, let him diligently pronounce the \nScripture proposed, with this Prayer which follows, which is, Theos Megale; And is \nmystically distorted, and miraculously and properly framed out of the Hebrew, Greek, \nand Chaldee Tongues, and it extendeth itself briefly into every Language, in what \nbeginning soever they are declared.

Wherefore Solomon made a \nspecial beginning of them, that they are to be pronounced at certain determinate \ntimes of the Moon; and not to be undertaken, without consideration of the end. \nWhich also Magister Apollonius hath fully and perfectly taught, saying, Whosoever \nwill pronounce these words, let him do it in a determinate appointed time, and set \naside all other occasions, and he shall profit in all Sciences in one Moneth, and attain \nto them in an extraordinary wonderful manner. \n\nThe Expositions of the lunations of the Rotary zArt. \n\nThese are the Expositions of the Lunation, and the Introduction of the Notory Art, \nto wit, in the fourth and the eighth day of the Moon; and in the twelfth, sixteenth, \nfour and twentieth, eight and twentieth, and thirteenth they ought to be put in \noperation. From whence Solomon saith, That to those times, we give the expositive \ntimes of the Moon; of the fourth day of the Moon, which are written by the four \nAngels; and in the fourth day of the Moon is manifested to us; and are four times \nrepeated and explained by the Angel, the Messenger of these Orations; and are also \nrevealed and delivered to us that require them from the Angel, four times of the \nyear, to shew the Eloquence and Fulness of the four Languages, Greek, Hebrew, \nChaldee and Latine; and God hath determined the Power of the Faculties of \nHumane Understanding, to the four Parts of the Earth; and also the four Vertues of \n\nHumanities, Understanding, Memory, Eloquence, and the Faculty of Ruling those \nthree. And these things are to be used as we have before spoken. \n\nIrie sheweth how the precedent Oration is the beginning and foundation of the whole \n\nzArt. \n\nThat is the first Figure of the Notory Art, which is manifestly sited upon a Quadran- \ngle Note: And this is Angelical Wisdom, understood of few in Astronomy; but in the \nGlass of Astrology, it is called, The Ring of Philosophy; and in the Notory Art it is \nwritten, To be the Foundation of the whole Science. But it is to be rehearsed four \ntimes a day, beginning in the morning once, about the third hour once, once in the \nninth hour, and once in the evening. \n\nThe precedent Oration ought to be spoken secretly; and let him that speaks it \nbe alone, and pronounce it with a low voyce, so that he scarcely hear himself. And \nthis is the condition hereof, that if necessity urge one to do any great works, he shall \nsay it twice in the morning, and about the ninth hour twice; and let him fast the first \nday wherein he rehearseth it, and let him chastly and devoutly. And this is the Ora- \ntion which he shall say: \n\nThis is the Oration of the four Tongues, Cha/dee, Greek, Hebrew and Latins, \nevidently expounded, which is called, The Splendor or Speculum of Wisdom. In all \nholy Lunations, these Orations ought to be read, once in the morning, once about \nthe third hour, and once in the evening. \n\nThe Oration. \n\nzAssaylemath, Assay, Lemath, Azzabue. \n\nThe second part of the precedent Orations, which is to be said only once. \nzAzzaylemath, Lemath, Azacgessenio. \n\nThe third part of the precedent Oration, which is to be spoken together with the other, \nfemath, Sabanche, Ellithy, Aygezo. \n\nThis Oration hath no Exposition in the fatine. \n\nThis is a holy Prayer, without danger of any sin, which Solomon saith, is inexplicable \nby humane sense. And he addeth, and saith, That the Explication thereof is more \nprolixious, than can be considered of or apprehended by Man; excepting also those \nsecrets, which is not lawful, neither is it given to Man to utter: Therefore he leaveth \nthis Oration without Exposition, because no Man could attain to the perfection \nthereof: and it was left so spiritual, because the Angel that declared it to Solomon, laid \nan inexcusable prohibition upon it, saying, See that thou do not presume to give to \nany other, not to expound anything out of this Oration, neither thy self, nor anyone \nby thee, nor anyone after thee: For it is a holy and Sacramental Mystery, that by \nexpressing the words thereof, God heareth thy Prayer, and increaseth thy Memory, \n\nUnderstanding, Eloquence, and establisheth them all in thee. Let it be read in \nappointed times of the Lunation; as, in the fourth day of the Moon, the eighth and \ntwelfth, as it is written and commanded: say that Oration very diligently four times \nin those dayes; verily believing, That thereby thy study shall suddenly be increased, \nand made clear, without any ambiguity, beyond the apprehension of humane Reason. \n\nOf the Efficacy of that Oration which is inexplicable to human sense. \n\nThis is that onely which Solomon calls The happiness of Wit: and M. Apollonius ter- \nmeth it, The Light of the Soul, and the Speculum of Wisdom: And, I suppose, the \nsaid Oration may be called, The Image of Eternal Life; the Vertue and Efficacy \nwhereof is so great, that is understood or apprehended of by very few or none. \n\nTherefore having essayed some Petitions, Signs and Precepts, we give them as \nan entrance to those things thereof we intended to speak; of which they are part, that \nwe have spoken of before. Nevertheless, before we come to speak of them, some \nthings are necessary to be declared, whereby we may more clearly and plainly set \nforth our intended History: For, as we have said before, there are certain Exceptions \nof the Notory Art; some whereof are dark and obscure, and others plain and mani- \nfest. \n\nFor the Notory Art hath a Book in Astronomy, whereof it is the Beginning and \nMistriss; and the Vertue thereof is such, that all Arts are taught and derived from her. \nAnd we are further to know, that the Notory Art doth in a wonderful manner con- \ntain and comprehend within it self, all Arts, and the Knowledge of all Learning, as \nSolomon witnesseth: Therefore it is called, The Notary Art, because in certain brief \nNotes, it teacheth and comprehendeth the Knowledge of all Arts: for so Solomon also \nsaith in his Treatise Lemegeton, that is, in his Treatise of Spiritual and Secret Experi- \nments. \n\nIrLere he £heweth, in what manner these C^(htes differ in zArt, and the 'Treason thereof \nfor a ZNhte is a certain knowledge, by the Oration and figure before set down. \n\nBut of the Orations and Figures, mention shall be made in their due place, and how \nthe Notes are called in the Notory Art. Now he maketh mention of that Oration, \nwhich is called, The Queen of Tongues: for amongst these Orations, there is more \nexcellent than the rest, which King Solomon would therefore have be called, The \nQueen of Tongues because it takes away, as it were, with a certain Secret covering the \nImpediments of the Tongue, and giveth it a marvellous Faculty of Eloquence. \nWherefore before we proceed further, take a little Essay of that Oration: For this is \nan Oration which in the Scriptures we are taught to have alwayes in our mouthes; but \nit is taken out of the Chaldean Language: which, although it be short, is of a wonder- \nful Vertue; that when you reade that Scripture, with the Oration before-mentioned, \nyou cannot keep silent those things, which the Tongue and Understand suggest, and \nadminister to thee.\n"

Therefore he calleth this a Notory Art, \nbecause it should be the Art of Arts, and Science of Sciences; which comprehendeth \nin itself all Arts and Sciences, Liberal and Mechanick: And those things which in \nother Arts are full of long and tedious locutions, filling up great prolixious Volumes \nof Books, wearying out the Student, through the length of time to attain them: In \nthis Art are comprehended very briefly in a few words or writings, so that it discov- \nered! those things which are hard and difficult making the ingenious learned in a \nvery short time, by the wonderful and unheard-of Vertue of the words. \n\nTherefore we, to whom such a faculty of the knowledge of the Scripture of Sci- \nences is granted, have wholly received this great gift, and inestimable benefit, from \nthe overflowing grace of the most high Creator.

When he had thus said he shewed to King \nSolomon a Book wherein was written, at what times all these always were to be pro- \nnounced and published, and plainly demonstrated it according to the Vision of God: \nWhich things I have heard and seen, did operate in them all, according to the Word \nof the Lord by the Angel: And so Solomon declareth, it came to pass unto him: But \nwe that come after him, ought to imitate his Authority, as much as we are able to \nobserve those things he hath left unto us. \n\nIriere Solomon sheweth how the zAngel told him distinctly, wherefore the Grammar hath \n\nthree figures. \n\nBehold wherefore the Grammatical Art hath only three Notes in the Book of \nSolomon; Gemeliath, that is, in the Book of the Art of God, which we read is the Art \nof all other Sciences, and of all other Arts; For Solomon saith, When did I inquire \neverything singularly of the Angel of God, with fear, saying, Lord, from whence shall \nthis come to passe to me, that I may fully and perfectly know this Art? Why do so \nmany Notes appertain to such an Art, and so many to such an Art, and are ascribed \nto several determinate Orations, to have the efficacy thereof? The Angel is thus said \nto answer: The Grammatical Art is called a liberal Art, and hath three things neces- \nsary thereunto; Ordination of words and times; and in them, of Adjuncts or Figures; \nSimple, compound and various; and a various declination of the parts to the parts, or \na relation from the parts, and a Congruent and ordinate division. This is the reason, \nwhy there is three Notes in the Art of Grammar: And so it pleased the Divine Wis- \ndom, that as there should be a full knowledge of declining by one; by another, that \nthere should be had a convenient Ordination of all the parts; by the third, there \nshould be had a continual and convenient Division of all the parts, simple and com- \npound. \n\nThe 'Treason why the '■Dialectical zArt hath two figures onely. \n\n'■Dialect, which is called the form of Arts, and a DocTxinal speech, hath two things \nnecessary thereunto, to wit, Eloquence of Arguing, and Prudence to answer; There- \nfore the greatness of the Divine Providence and Piety, hath appointed two Notes to \nit; that by the first, we may have Eloquence to Argue and Dispute; and by the sec-\n"

For there are four things necessary \ntherein; as the Angel of the Lord said unto Solomon; to wit, a continual and flourish- \ning adornment of locution, An ordinate, competent and discreet judgement, a Testi- \nmony of Causes or Offices, of Chances 8c Losses, a composed disposition of buying \nand selling; An Eloquence of the matters of that Art, with a demonstrative under- \nstanding. Therefore the greatness of God hath appointed to the Art of Rhetorick four \nNotes, with their Holy and Glorious Orations; as they were reverently sent by the \nHand of God; that every Note in that Art aforesaid, might have a several faculty, \nThat the first Note in that Art, might give a continual locution, a competent and flo- \nrishing adornment thereof: The second, to discern Judgements, just and unjust, ordi- \nnate and inordinate, true and false: The third, competently to discover offices and \ncauses: and the fourth giveth understanding and Eloquence in all the operations in \nthis Art, without prolixity.

Oh Father, incomprehensible, \nfrom whom proceedeth everything that is good; whose greatness is incomprehensi- \nble: hear this day my Prayers, which I make in thy sight, and grant to me the Joy of \nthy saving health, that I may teach unto the wicked the wayes and Paths of thy Sci- \nences, and convert the Rebellious 8c incredulous unto thee, that whatsoever I com- \nmemorate and repeat in my heart and mouth, may take root and foundation in me; \nthat I may be made powerful and efficacious in thy works, zAmen. \n\nSay this Oration before the 6 Note of Philosophy; Gezemothon, Oronathian, \nHeyatha, Aygyay, Lethasihel, Iaechizliet, Gerohay, Gerhomay, Sanoaesorel, Sanasathel, \nGissiomo, Hatel, Segomasay, Azomathon, Helomathon, Gerochor, Hojazay, Samin, Heliel, \nSanihelyel, Siloth, Silerech, Garamathal, Gesemathal, Gecoromay, Gecorenay, Samyel, \nSamihahel, Hesemyhel, Sedolamax, Secothamay, Samya, Rabiathos, Avinosch, Annas, \nzAmen. \n\nThen say the following: Oh eternal King!

And when the Angel of the Lord \nappeareth to thee, keep and conceal the words and writings he revealeth to thee; and \nobserve them to practice and operate in them, observing all things with great rever- \nence, and pronounce them at the appointed dayes and hours, as before is directed; \nand afterwards say; Sapienter die illo; Age, &amp; caste vivas. But if thou dost anything \nuncertain, there is danger; as thou wilt have experience from the other Notes and \nOrations of them, but consider that which is most wonderful in those Orations; for \nthese words are ineffable Names, and are spiritually to be pronounced before the \nineffable Note, Hosel, Jesel, Anchiator, Aratol, Hasiatol, Gemor, Gesameor. Those are the \nOrations which ought to be pronounced after the inspection of all the Arts, and after \nthe Note of Theology.\n"

In the beginning of the knowledge of all \nArts there is given almost the perfect DocTxine of operating: I say almost, because \nsome flourishing institutions hereof remain, whereof this is the first beginning. \n\nTiow the Trecepts are to be observed in the operation of all zArts. \n\nObserve the 4 (C in every operation of Theology. Exhibit that operation with effi- \ncacy every 4 (C quartram lunam; and diligently look into the books and writings of \nthose Arts; if thou doubt of any of the Chapters, they are to be pronounced, as is \ntaught of the superior Chapters; but know this, that these Holy Words of Orations, \nwe appoint to be said before the bed of the sick, for an experiment of life or death. \nAnd this thou maist do often, if thou wil to perate nothing else in the whole body of \nArt: And know this; that if thou hast not the books in thy hands, or the faculty of \nlooking into them is not given to thee; the effecl: of this work will not be the lesse \ntherefore: but the Orations are twice then to be pronounced, where they were to be \nbut once: And as to the knowledge of a vision, and the other virtues which these \nHoly Orations have; thou maist prove and try them, when and how thou wilt. \n\nThese Trecepts are specially to be observed. \n\nBut when thou would' st operate in Theology, observe only those dayes which are \nappointed; but all times are convenient for those Notes and Orations, for which there \nis a competent time given; but in the pronounciation of the three liberal Arts, or in \nthe inspection of their Notes, perhaps thou maist pretermit some day appointed, if \nthou observe the rest; or if thou transgress two dayes, leave not off the work, for it \nloseth not its effecl: for this, for the Moon is more to be observed in the greater num- \nbers than the dayes or hours. For Solomon saith, If thou miss a day or two, fear not, \nbut operate on the general Chapters. This is enough to say of them: but by no means \nforget any of the words which are to be said in the beginning of the reading to attain \nto Arts; for there is great virtue in them. And thou maist frequently use the Holy \nWords of the visions: but if thou wouldst operate in the whole body of the Physical \nArt, the first Chapters are first to be repeated as before are defined. And in Theology, \nthou must operate only by thy self: Often repeat the Orations, and look into the \nNotes of Theology: this produceth great effefts. It is necessary that thou have the \nNote of the 24 Angels always in Memory; and faithfully keep those things, which the \nAngel reveales to thee in the vision. \n\nThe Experiment of the precedent work, is the beginning of the following Orations, which \n\nSolomon calleth Artem Novam.^ \n\nThese Orations may be said before all Arts generally, and before Notes specially; and \nthey may be pronounced without any other Chapters, if thou wouldst operate in any \n\n1. This section begins Part III of the text. Note that the fifth section of the Lemegeton is also \ncalled Artem Novem, but the prayers there bear no relation to those shown here.\n"

And before thou begin \nto try any of these subtle works, it is good to fast two or three dayes; that is may be \nDivinely revealed, whether thy desires be good or evil. \n\nThese are the precepts appointed before every operation; but if thou doubt of \nany beginning, either of the three first Chapters, or of the four subsequent Arts, that \nthou maist have the effecl: of perfecl: knowledge; if thou consider and pronounce \nthese Orations, as they are above described, although thou overpass something igno- \nrantly; thou maist be reconciled by the spiritual virtue of the subsequent Orations. \n\nThe Angel said of these Orations to Solomon: See the Holiness of these Ora- \ntions; and if thou hast transgrest any therein presumtuously or ignorantly, say rever- \nently and wisely these Orations, of which the Angel saith: This is a great Sacrament \nof God, which the Lord sendeth to thee by my hand; at the veneration of which Sac- \nrament, when King Solomon offered with great patience before the Lord upon the \nAlter, he saw the book covered with fine linen, and in this book were written 10 Ora- \ntions, and upon every Oration the sign of a golden Seal: and he heard in his Spirit, \nThese are they which the Lord hath figured, and are far excluded from the hearts of \nthe unfaithful. \n\nTherefore Solomon trembled, lest he should offend the Lord, and kept them, \nsaying it was wickedness to reveal them to unbelievers: but he that would learn any \ngreator spiritual thing in any Art or necessary Science, if he cannot have a higher \nwork, he may say these Orations at what time soever he will; the three first, for the \nthree first liberal Arts; a several Oration for every several Art, or generally all of the \nthree for the three Arts are to be said; and in like manner the four subsequent Ora- \ntions, for four other liberal Arts. And if thou wouldst have the whole body of Art, \nwithout any definition of time, thou maist pronounce these Orations before the sev- \neral Arts, and before the Orations and Notes of these Arts, as often as thou wilt, \nmanifestly and secretly; but beware that thou live chastly and soberly in the pronun- \nciation thereof. \n\nThis is the first Oration of the 10, which may be pronounced by its self, without \nany precedent work to acquire Memory, Eloquence and understanding, and stable- \nness of these three, and singularly to be rehearsed before the first Figure of Theology: \nOmnipotent, Incomprehensible, invisible and indissolvable Lord God; I adore this \nday thy Holy Name; I, an unworthy and miserable sinner, do lift up my Prayer, \nunderstanding and reason towards thy Holy and Heavenly Temple, declaring thee, O\n"

The \nsecond species is fasting and praying, for the praying man God heareth. The third \nspecies is chastity; he that would Operate in this Art, let him be clean and chast by \nthe space of nine dayes at least; And before you begin, it is necessary that you know \nthe time of the (£ it is proper to Operate in this Art: and when you begin so sacred \nan Art, have a care to abstain from all mortal sins, at least while you are proceeding in \nthis work until it be finished and compleated: and when you begin to operate, say this \nverse kneeling: Lift up the light of thy Countenance upon me, Oh Lord my God, \nand forsake not me thy Servant N. that trusts in thee: Then say three times Pater \nNoster, &amp;c. And assert that thou wilt never commit wilfull perjury, but alwayes perse- \nvere in faith and hope. This being done, with bended knees in the place wherein thou \nwilt operate, say, Our help is in the Name of the Lord, who hath made Heaven and \nEarth: and I will enter into the Invocation of the most high, unto him who enlighte- \nneth and purifieth my Soul and Conscience, which dwelleth under the help of the \nmost high, and continueth under the protection of the God of Heaven: O Lord open \nand unfold the doubts of my Heart, and change me into a new man by thy love: be \nthou Oh Lord unto me true faith, the hope of my life, and perfect charity, to declare \nthy wonders. Let us pray: then say the Oration following: \n\nOh God my God, who from the beginning hast Created all things out of noth- \ning, and reformest all things by thy Spirit; restore my Conscience, and heal my \nunderstanding, that I may glorify thee in all my thoughts, words and deeds; through \nhim who liveth and reigneth with thee forever, zAmen. \n\nNow in the Name of Christ, on the first day of the Month, in which thou \nwouldst acquire Memory, Eloquence and Understanding, and stability thereof, with \na perfect, good and contrite Heart, and sorrow for thy sins committed; thou maist \nbegin to pronounce these Orations following, which appertain to the obtaining of \nMemory and all Sciences, and which were composed and delivered by the Angel to \nSolomon, from the hand of God. \n\nThe first and last Oration of this Art is Alpha and Omega: Oh God omnipo- \ntent, &amp;c. \n\nThis following is an Oration of four Languages, which is this: Hely, Schemat, \nAzatan, honiel sichut, tarn, imel, latatandema, Jetromiam, Theos; Oh Holy and strong \nGod, Hamacha, mal, Gottneman, Alazaman, zay, zojeracim, Lam hay, Masaraman, \ngrensi zamach, heliamat, seman, selmar, yetrosaman muchaer, vesar, hasarian Azaniz, \nAzamet, Amathemach, hersomini.

This Oration ought to follow the first of the ten above written. \n\nTo perform any work. \n\nThis is to follow the third Oration above: I confess, O Theos hazamagielgezuzan, \nsazaman, Sathaman, getormantas, salathiel, nesomel, megal, vnieghama, yazamir, zeyha- \nman, hamarnal amna, nisza, deleth, hazamaloth, moy pamazathoran, hanasuelnea, sacro- \nmomem, gegonoman, zaramacham Cades bachet girtassoman, gyseton palaphatos halathel \nOsachynan machay, zAmen. \n\nThis is a true and approved experiment, to understand all Arts and secrets of the \nWorld, to find out and dig up minerals and treasure; This was revealed by the Heav- \nenly Angel in this Notory Art. For this Art doth also declare things to come, and \nrendereth the sense capable of all Arts in a short time, by the Divine use thereof. \n\nWe are to speak also of the time and place. First therefore, all these precepts are \nto be observed and kept; and the Operator ought to be clean, chaste, to repent of his \nsins, and earnestly desire to cease from sinning as much as may be; and so let him \nproceed, and every work shall be investigated into him, by the Divine Ministery \n\nWhen thou wilt operate in the new Moon, kneeling say this verse: Lift up the \nlight of thy Countenance upon us, Oh God, and forsake us not, Oh Lord our God. \nThen say three times the Pater Noster. And afterwards let him vow unto God that he \nwill never commit wilfull perjury, but alwayes persist in faith. This being done, at \nnight say with bended knees before thy bed; Our help is in the Name of the Lord, \n&amp;c. and this Psalm; Whoso dwelleth under the shadow of the wings of the most \nhigh, to the end; and the Lords Prayer, and the Prayer following. \n\nTheos Pater vehamans; God of Angels, I Pray and invocate thee by thy most \nHoly Angels Eliphamasay, Gelomiros, Gedo bonay, Saranana, Elomnia, and by all the \nHoly Names, by us not to be pronounced, which are these: do. el. x p n k h t li g y y. \nnot to be spoken, or comprehended by humane sense; I beseech thee, cleanse my \nConscience with the Splendor of thy Name; illustrate and confirm my understanding \nwith the sweet savour of thy Holy Spirit: Oh Lord Adorne my Soul, that I may \nunderstand and perfectly remember what I hear; reform my Heart, and restore my \nHeart, and restore my sense Oh Lord God, and heal my bowels: open my mouth \nmost merciful God, and frame and temper my Tongue to the praise and glory of thy \nName, by thy glorious and unspeakable Name. O Lord, who art the Fountain of all \ngoodness, and original of all piety, have patience with me, and give unto me a true \nunderstanding, to know whatsoever is fitting for me, and retain the same in Memory: \nthou who dost not presently Judge a sinner, but mercifully expeftest repentance; I \nbeseech thee, though unworthy, to wash away the filth of my sins and wickedness, \nand grant me my petitions, to the praise and glory of thy Holy Name; who liveth and \nreignest one God in perfect Trinity, World without end, zAmen.\n"

          "text": "11 \n\nForeword \n\nThis  is  an  extremely  important  book  for  both  the  history  and  the  practice  of \nmagic  in  Europe  and  the  Eastern  Mediterranean,  because  it  forms  the  bridge \nbetween  the  Greek  magic  of  the  Middle  Ages  and  the  later  grimoires  of  Italy \nand  the  rest  of  Europe.  It  is  in  fact  this  text  which  is  the  source  of  the  Key  of \nSolomon,  the  most  widely  disseminated  grimoire  in  Europe,  from  which  a \nwhole  host  of  other  European  grimoires  derived.  It  is  the  procedures  and  the \nspirits  found  in  the  Magical  Treatise  of  Solomon  which  crop  up  again  and  again \nin  Latin  grimoires  from  the  15*  century  onwards. \n\nAlthough  there  has  always  been  dissémination  of  magical  manuscripts  in  the \neastern  Mediterranean,  it  is  noteworthy  that  the  oldest  manuscript  of  the  Key \nof  Solomon  is  16th  century,  and  thus  not  older  than  the  Magical  Treatise.  The \ntransition  probably  occurred  around  the  time  of  the  Muslim  sack  of \nConstantinople  in  1453  which  caused  a  wave  of  scholars  to  bring  Greek \nmanuscripts  to  the  relative  safety  of  Italy,  where  the  new  knowledge  helped \nto  ignite  the  Italian  Renaissance.  Amongst  these  manuscripts  was  almost \ncertainly  copies  of  the  Magical  Treatise.  The  transition  from  the  Greek  to  the \nLatin  speaking  world  was  not  ail  plain  sailing,  and  a  number  of  magical \nsecrets  failed  to  be  translated  fully  to  the  Latin  grimoires,  because  either  the \ntranslator  did  not  understand  them  or  thought  they  were  too  dangerous  to  be \nrecorded.  It  is  therefore  for  this  reason  that  many  of  the  perplexing  passages \nin  the  grimoires  can  only  be  fully  understood  by  a  thorough  reading  of  the \nMagical  Treatise.  A  certain  coyness  set  in  with  the  transition  into  Latin.  For \nexample,  in  the  process,  names  like  Loutzipher,  Beelzebub  and  Satan  tend  to \ndisappear  completely  leaving  the  infernal  hierarchy  incomplète,  or  get \nhidden  behind  initiais  like  'L.B.S.'  Magic  is  nothing  if  not  hierarchical,  and \nthis  loss  also  applied  to  the  Démon  Kings  of  the  four  quarters. \n\nNot  only  is  it  now  possible  to  understand  grimoire  magic  at  greater  depth,  but  it \nis  also  possible  to  dispose  of  the  myth  that  the  Key  of  Solomon  was  translated \nfrom  a  Hebrew  original.  Although  there  may  hâve  been  some  Jewish  input  long \nbefore,  many  of  the  ingrédients  of  the  Magical  Treatise,  like  the  spirit  hierarchy, \nor  the  use  of  the  typically  Greek  black  handled  knife,  are  completely  Greek. \n\nInstances  where  only  the  Magical  Treatise  can  explain  what  the  Key  of  Solomon \nrefers  to  include  the  use  of  the  blood  of  a  bat  (p.  88).  Other  grimoires  are\n"

There  are  for  example  also  explanations  why  the  Liber \nJuratus  Honorii  uses  the  blood  of  the  bat  and  certain  parchments  (see  p.  79  for \nthe  parchments  of  the  benefic  planets)  for  creating  the  Seal.  The  Magical \nTreatise  also  contains  detailed  material  about  plants,  which  became  divorced \nfrom  the  grimoires  in  the  Latin  West.  It  is  the  origin  of  the  planetary  plants \nlist  in  the  Book  of  Secrets  of  Albertus  Magnus  (  p.  81). \n\nIt  is  also  the  origin  of  certain  Key  (ACF  version)  chapters  conceming  the  black \nhandled  knife,  the  quill,  the  virgin  parchment,  the  'unbom'  parchment,  the \nvirgin  wax,  and  the  virgin  clay.  The  reasons  behind  various  observances  and \nritual  apparel,  such  as  the  crown,  shoes,  become  apparent.  Most  importantly, \nthe  exact  protective  circle  design  dérivés  from  the  Magical  Treatise,  and \nperplexing  features  like  the  three  Tock  marks'  to  be  seen  in  the  drawing  of \nthe  Key  ofSolomon  circle  (Wellcome  MS  4670)  can  be  seen  in  the  magical  seals \nin  Genadianus  MS  45. \n\nThe  Treatise  is  the  origin  of  the  names  of  the  chief  démons  that  can  be  found \nin  the  Grimorium  Verum,  Grand  Grimoire,  UTF  version  of  the  Key,  and  also  in \nAbramelin,  in  fact  without  it  the  hierarchy  of  the  spirits  of  the  Goetia  makes \nno  sense.  The  placing  of  beans  in  the  mouth  for  the  operation  of  invisibility  in \nthe  Grimorium  Verum  is  also  clarified  in  the  Treatise.  In  ail,  the  Magical  Treatise \nis  the  source  of  very  many  of  the  traditions  of  European  ritual  magic. \n\nYou  will  notice  that  a  number  of  passages  appear  to  be  repeated  in  this  book. \nThis  occurs  where  sections  of  different  manuscripts  were  very  similar.  It  was \ndecided  that  it  was  more  complété,  and  more  academically  honest,  to \nprovide  the  different  versions  in  full,  rather  than  either  choosing  just  one \nmanuscript  over  the  other  versions,  or  taking  A  E  Waite's  approach  of \ncombining  them  into  a  synthetic  whole,  in  which  it  is  not  possible  to  décidé \nwhich  passage  came  from  what  source.  Although  it  was  much  more  work, \nwe  decided  upon  the  more  complété  route.  Nevertheless  there  are  minor,  but \ntelling,  différences  between  the  different  versions,  one  adding  a  détail  that \nthe  other  omitted,  thereby  allowing  the  reader  to  appreciate  the  différences, \nand  décidé  for  himself  which  text  he  prefers.  The  translations  are  in  roughly \nchronological  order,  with  the  oldest  appearing  first,  so  it  is  possible  to  track \nthe  development  of  this  text.  Read  in  conjunction  with  a  full  version  of  the \nKey  of  Solomon,  many  of  the  perplexing  parts  of  the  grimoires  become \nimmediately  clear.1 \n\nStephen  Skinner, \nSingapore,  September  2011. \n\n1  See  the  Véritable  Key  of  Solomon,  2008,  in  this  same  sériés,  SWCM  Vol.  IV.\n"

Joseph  Heeg  edited  the  text,  and  he  also  provided  a  list  of  four  other \nrelevant  manuscripts:  Taurinensis  C  VII  15,  Parisinus  Gr.  2419,  plus  two \nCodices  Athenienses,  possessed  by  Politis  but  not  examined  by  Heeg  himself.2 \nJudging  from  the  description  of  the  latter  two  manuscripts,  they  probably \nwere  Atheniensis  115  and  Atheniensis  167. \n\nWhen  volume  X  of  the  Catalogus  was  published  in  1924,  dedicated  to  the \nAthenian  manuscripts,  Armand  Delatte  described  the  Codices  Athenienses \n1265,  115,  and  167  and  included  certain  extracts  from  them.  However,  he \nconfined  himself  mostly  to  the  astrological  sections  of  the  work,  as  the  title  of \nthe  sériés  demanded. \n\nAfterwards,  in  1927,  he  published  the  évocation  and  divination  related \nmaterial  that  was  included  in  the  Athenian  manuscripts  under  the  title \nAnecdota  Atheniensia  I.  In  an  extensive  appendix,  Delatte  also  published  major \nparts  of  other  manuscripts  with  relevant  material,  namely  Harleianus  5596, \nParisinus  2419,  Bononiensis  Univers.  3632,  Neapolitanus  II  C  33, \nMediolanensis  H  2  infer.,  Vindobonensis  Phil.  Gr.  108,  Mediolanensis  E  37 \nsup.  and  Athonicus  Dion.  282. \n\nThe  Catalogus  sériés  was  completed  in  1936  with  volume  XII,  dedicated \nto  the  manuscripts  of  Saint  Petersburg.  Three  more  codices  mentioned  in  that \nvolume  seemed  to  hâve  close  connections  with  the  Magical  Treatise,  namely \nPetropolitanus  Academicus  Musaei  Palaeographici,  Bibl.  Publicae  575  and \nBibl.  Publicae  Gr.  646.  Delatte  published  certain  parts  of  the  first  manuscript \nin  1949,  in  his  monograph  Le  traité  des  Plantes  Planétaires  d'un  manuscript  de \nLéningrad.  In  the  same  monograph,  Delatte  cited  a  list  of  the  fifteen  relevant \nmanuscripts  known  at  the  time,  along  with  their  abbreviations.  These  same \nabbreviations  will  be  used  in  the  présent  book: \n\n1  Politis,  Palaiographikë  Stakhyologia,  p.  557. \n\n2  Boll  (ed.),  Catalogus  Codicum  Astrologorum  Graecorum,  VIII  2,  pp.  139-140.\n"

Another  description \ncan  be  found  in  McCown's  Testament  ofSolomon,  pp.  21-25. \n\nIt  was  written  in  1440  by  a  physician  named  Iôannës  of  Aron.  The  word \nAron  could  be  the  name  an  unknown  location  or  his  father's  name,  Aaron.  If \nthe  latter  case  is  true,  Iôannës  was  probably  a  Christianized  Jew.  Some  words \nor  phrases  appear  encoded.  The  cryptography  of  the  codex  is  very  close  to \nthe  one  used  in  Vaticanus  Gr.  1809.  McCown  believes  that  even  if  the  scribe \nhad  no  relation  to  the  monastery  of  Grottaferrata,  where  a  similar  code  was \ninvented,  there  is  no  doubt  that  he  lived  in  Italy.1 \n\nFf.  1-261  contain  medical  material,  and  then  the  astrological,  divinatory \nand  magical  material  follows.  This  manuscript  does  not  really  contain  parts \nof  the  Magical  Treatise,  but  some  of  its  divination  methods  can  be  found \nconnected  with  the  Treatise  in  other  manuscripts.  Among  the  divinatory \nmaterial,  one  can  find  version  I  of  the  water  divination  (ff.  344v-345),  the \névocation  of  the  black  démon  (f.  346),  the  fingernail  divination  (ff.  346-346v), \ntwo  versions  of  the  mirror  divination  (ff .  347  and  349v-350),  the  crystal  stone \ndivination,  the  copper  bowl  divination  (f.  347v),  necromancy  (ff.  348v-349) \nand  divination  by  means  of  a  basin,  a  kettle  and  a  glass  (ff.  350v-351). \n\nExcept  for  the  divinatory  methods,  B  2  contains  many  magical  recipes  and \na  part  of  the  Book  ofWisdom  of  Apollonius  (f.  359v).2  Immediately  after  this,  there \nare  three  folios  (ff.  360-361)  depicting  forty  nine  talismans  which  are  irrelevant \nto  the  Magical  Treatise,  with  the  exception  of  one  (see  the  analysis  of  section  32, \nabout  the  ring  of  Solomon).  The  manuscript  also  contains  a  work  ascribed  to \nHermes  Trismegistos  concerning  the  zodiacal  and  planetary  herbs  (ff.  435v- \n436).

F.  2  bears  the  number  13,  revealing  that  the \nfirst  five  folios  hâve  disappeared.

Nine  folios  are  torn  off  after  this  and  f.  14  continues  with  six \nmagical  recipes.

Ff.  21v-28  contain  magical  recipes  again,  interrupted  by \nthe  operation  of  imprisoning  a  spirit  in  a  bottle  (ff.  26-27).

The  original  scribe  adds  in  ff.  36-39v  some  more  recipes.  A  17th \ncentury  scribe  has  filled  ff.  40-46v  with  more  recipes,  plus  the  bottle \ndivination  (ff.  41-41v)  and  the  beginning  of  the  évocation  of  the  black  démon \n(f.  46v),  Ff.  50-61  are  written  by  several  later  hands  and  contain  magical \nrecipes  and  some  astrological  material.\n"

The  first  one  wrote  ff.  2-90v,  the  second  ff.  91- \n128,  followed  again  by  the  first  scribe,  who  wrote  ff.  132-150.  Ff.  150v-152  were \nwritten  by  a  third  scribe.  It  was  illuminated  by  one  Kyrillos  Korydalleus,  as  f .  53 \ninforms  us.  In  1714  the  manuscript  was  in  the  possession  of  a  Russianmonk  of \nthe  monastery  of  St.  Nicolaus,  Moscow,  who  migrated  to  Kazan,  Tartarstan. \nDuring  the  19*  century  it  was  in  the  hands  of  Gabriel  Solncev,  a  prof  essor  of  the \nKazan  University,  who,  in  his  tum,  gave  it  to  his  colleague  Fr.  Erdmann. \n\nThis  manuscript  belonged  to  the  Palaeographic  Muséum  of  the  Science \nAcademy  of  St.  Petersberg  until  the  muséum  was  closed  in  1938. \nUnfortunately,  I  hâve  not  been  able  to  discover  where  it  is  kept  at  the  moment. \nAlthough  Delatte's  Le  Traité  des  Plantes  Planétaires  was  dedicated  to  it,  the \nauthor  did  not  mention  where  it  was  kept  in  1949.

It  contains \nastrological,  magical,  divinatory  and  medical  material.  F.  53  préserves  only  the \nintroduction  of  the  Treatise,  followed  by  an  irrelevant  recipe  for  taking  out  a \ntreasure  (f.  53v).  Ff.  54-55v  contain  the  method  of  imprisoning  a  spirit  in  a \nbottle,  as  it  appears  in  A.  Unfortunately,  the  latter  section  is  not  included  in  the \nCatalogus,  so  it  is  not  translated  here.

Of \nthese  manuscripts,  P  alone  cites  the  introduction  without  a  title.  A2,  on  the \nother  hand,  contains  a  title  but  no  introduction.  The  introduction  consists  of \nSolomon's  exhortation  to  Rehoboam,  to  pay  attention  to  the  details  of  the  art. \nThis  is  usually  folio wed  by  Rehoboam' s  question  to  Solomon,  regarding  the \nvirtue  of  things,  and  by  Solomon's  reply  that  the  virtue  of  things  lies  in  herbs, \nwords  and  stones.  In  H  and  P  this  part  is  missing.  It  concludes  with  some \ninformation  about  astrology,  introducing  us  to  the  next  part  of  the  work. \n\nThere  are  some  problems  concerning  the  syntax  and  content  of  the \nintroduction,  something  that  gives  the  impression  that  both  the  title  and  the \nintroduction  are  the  resuit  of  a  long  process  of  rédaction.  It  seems  that  the \noldest  form  is  a  kind  of  dialogue  between  Solomon  and  Rehoboam,  like  the \nM  variant \n\nPay  attention,  my  dearest  son  Rehoboam,  to  the  details  of  this  art,  regarding  the \nthings  in  which  the  entire  interest  of  the  Hygromanteia  lies...  And  Rehoboam \nasked  him:  \"Father,  in  which  things  does  the  virtue  of  things  résidé?\"  And \nSolomon  replied:  \"In  herbs,  in  words  and  in  stones.\" \n\nHowever,  the  question  of  Rehoboam  in  the  text  does  not  fit  the  initial \nexhortation  of  Solomon.  It  is  évident  that  the  initial  statement  of  Solomon \nshould  rather  be:  \"Pay  attention,  my  dearest  son  Rehoboam,  to  the  details  of \nthis  art,  regarding  the  things  in  which  the  virtue  of  things  lies\",  not \ncontaining  the  word  ' Hygromanteia '  originally. \n\nIt  also  évident  that  the  work,  as  it  stands,  has  little  relevance  to  herbs. \nOne  section  for  the  zodiacal  herbs  and  one  for  the  planetary  herbs  do  not \njustify  this  preamble,  as  we  would  otherwise  expect  a  more  vital  rôle  to  be \ngiven  to  them,  as  in  the  Ky ranidés.  The  same  remarks  apply  to  the  stones, \nsince  there  is  no  such  section.  It  is  not  a  far-fetched  theory  to  suppose  that\n"

          "text": "33 \n\nThe  Magical  Treatise  of  Solomon \n\nthis  part  of  the  introduction  initially  belonged  to  an  unknown  herbarium  and \nlapidarium.  The  author  may  hâve  taken  these  phrases  and  attached  them  as  an \nintroduction  to  his  own  work  on  magic.  Another  plausible  explanation \nwould  be  that  an  unknown  lapidarium  was  originally  an  intégral  part  of  a \nconsiderably  shorter  Magical  Treatise,  together  with  the  two  sections  of  the \nastrological  herbs,  but  the  later  scribes  did  not  preserve  it. \n\nIt  is  interesting  to  note  here  that  the  reference  to  \"herbs,  words  and \nstones\"  is  preserved  in  a  number  of  other  works,  including  the  Compendium \nMedicinae  of  Gilbertus  Anglicus,  the  poem  Sidrak  and  Bokkus,  John  of \nArdenre's  treatise  on  hemorrhoids  and  Guy  de  Chauliac's  Cyrurgie.1  In  each \ncase,  God  is  said  to  hâve  put  virtue  in  them.  The  latter  work  attributes  the \nphrase  to  empirical  healers.2 \n\nIt  is  also  interesting  to  examine  the  titles  of  the  various  versions.  In  D, \nthe  title  is  The  little  key  of  the  entire  art  of  Hygromanteia,  discover ed  by  various \nauthors  and  composed  by  Solomon,  in  which  he  seems  to  write  to  his  son,  Rehoboam. \nAnd  in  M  it  is  The  little  key  ofthe  entire  art  of  Hygromanteia,  discovered  by  various \nartisans  and  the  holy  prophet  Solomon,  in  which  he  seems  to  write  to  his  son, \nRehoboam.  However,  no  other  manuscript  does  contain  the  word \n'Hygromanteia.'  Thus,  in  T,  the  title  is  The  Instruction  of  Solomon  to  his  son \nJéroboam,  while  in  P2  it  is  From  the  Instruction  of  Solomon  the  wise  to  his  son \nRehoboam:  An  excerpt  from  his  Instruction  for  us  to  follow,  with  the  subtitle \nInstruction. \n\nThe  English  translation  makes  it  impossible  to  discern  that  there  is  in  fact \na  syntax  error  in  both  cases,  but  it  is  évident  in  Greek.  The  relative  pronoun \nhë  (which)  is  a  féminine  one  and  refers  to  the  \"instruction\"  (hermëneia, \nféminine),  not  to  the  \"little  key\"  ( kleidion ,  neutral),  thus  giving  an  attestation \nthat  the  phrase  The  little  key  ofthe  entire  art  of  Hygromanteia  is  a  rédaction  and \nthat  the  original  title  might  be  The  Instruction  of  Solomon.  Yet,  both \nHygromanteia  and  art  ( tekhnë )  are  also  féminine  words,  so  the  rédaction  could \nalso  be  either  the  phrase  The  little  key  ofthe  entire  art  of  or  just  the  phrase  The \nlittle  key  of \n\nHygromanteia  is  a  word  that  means  \"water  divination\"  and  it  seems \npeculiar  to  appear  in  the  title  of  a  work  related  to  astrological  magic  and \névocation.  Torijano  explains  the  title  by  the  possible  loss  of  pages  in  an \n\n1  See  Karr  &amp;  Skinner,  Sepher  Raziel,  Golden  Hoard.  Singapore,  2010,  where  the  sections  on \nherbs,  stones,  and  animais  are  repeatedly  stressed  as  being  intégral  to  the  magical  method  laid \nout  there.  Obviously  the  third  category,  words,  always  formed  part  ofthe  magical  method. \n\n2  Bishop,  Words,  Stones  &amp;  Herbs,  p.  92.\n"

          "text": "34 \n\nThe  Magical  Treatise  of  Solomon \n\noriginal  manuscript  that  contained  an  actual  water  divination  before  the \nTreatise.1  This  is  a  plausible  theory,  since  in  P  a  water  divination  is  indeed \ncited  before  it.  Greenfield,  on  the  other  hand,  argues  that  the  similarities \nbetween  the  main  rite  of  the  circle  and  the  various  water  divinations \ndescribed  in  the  manuscripts  are  striking.  He  goes  on  to  suggest  that  a  water \ndivination  text-book  may  hâve  been  in  existence  prior  to  the  15th  century, \ncontaining  a  ritual  for  summoning  démons  to  a  circle  by  means  of  a  basin, \ntogether  with  complex  préparations  and  astrological  information.  Eventually, \nthe  basin  will  hâve  been  dropped  out  of  the  main  ritual,  leaving  the  text  as  it \nis  today.2  This  theory  is  also  plausible,  as  divinations  that  use  both  a  circle \nand  a  water  pot  hâve  survived. \n\nA  third  theory  has  been  proposed  by  Skinner  and  Rankine.  According  to \nthem,  the  word  Hygromanteia  does  not  mean  water  divination  in  this  context, \nbut  applies  to  the  ancient  practice  of  constraining  démons  in  hydriai,  that  is  to \nsay  ums,  water  jars  or  metallic  water  vessels.  This  practice  was  frequently \nlinked  with  Solomon,  not  only  in  the  Testament,  but  also  in  the  writings  of  the \n4th  century  Byzantine  historian  Zosimus  and  in  a  6th  century  account  of \nJérusalem  recorded  in  the  Breviarius  de  Hierosolyma.3 4  This  is  another  plausible \ntheory,  since  in  some  manuscripts  an  occult  technique  is  cited  with  the  aim  of \nimprisoning  spirits  in  bottles,  and  this  technique  is  named  Gasteromanteia, \nthat  is  to  say  \"bottle  divination\". \n\nAs  regards  the  remaining  three  titles,  P3  bears  the  irrelevant  title \nComposition  of  the  second  book,  probably  related  to  the  structure  of  the \nmanuscript  which  was  used  as  a  prototype.  The  title  of  A2,  Prayer  and \nconjurations  of  the  prophet  Solomon  against  démons,  seems  not  to  be  the  title  of \nthe  entire  work,  but  of  the  sections  included  in  the  manuscript.  Finally,  in  H, \nthe  title  is  Beginning  of  the  Magical  Treatise  ofgathering  and  directing  the  spirits. \n\nIn  fact,  the  title  of  H,  Apotelesmatikë  Pragmateia,  could  be  altematively \ntranslated  in  many  other  ways,  such  as  Treatise  on  celestial  influences, \nAstrological  treatise,  Effective  treatise  or  even  Talismanic  treatise.  I  hâve  followed \nthe  translation  originally  given  by  Delatte,  Traité  de  Magie,*  translated  by \nGreenfield  as  Magic  Treatise  and  by  Torijano  as  Magical  Treatise.  This  is  by \nconvention  only,  as  I  do  not  believe  that  it  is  necessarily  more  accurate  than \nthe  other  translations. \n\n1  Torijano,  Solomon  the  Esoteric  King,  pp.  1 52-153. \n\n2  Greenfield,  Traditions  ofBelief,  pp.  160-161. \n\n3  Skinner  and  Rankine  (eds.),  The  Véritable  Key  of  Solomon,  pp.  56-57. \n\n4  Delatte  (ed.),  Anecdota  Atheniensia,  pp.  397.\n"

          "text": "35 \n\nThe  Magical  Treatise  of  Solomon \n\nHowever  I  generally  use  this  same  phrase  throughout  the  présent \nédition  in  order  to  name  the  text  itself.  This  is  because  the  word  Hygromanteia \nalso  serves  as  the  title  of  various  water  divinations  in  the  manuscripts,  and \nthe  concurrent  use  of  the  same  title  for  two  different  things  may  lead  to \nconfusion.  Note  that  Torijano  makes  a  distinction  between  the  astrological \nand  the  magical  parts  of  the  text,  naming  the  entire  work  Hygromanteia  and \nthe  parts  related  to  magic,  the  Magical  Treatise. 1  Although  indicated  by \nDelatte,1 2 3  such  a  distinction  is  mistaken,  as  it  is  not  supported  by  the \nmanuscripts. \n\nMcCown,  on  the  other  hand,  accepts  that  this  text  is  a  Greek  form  of  the \nClavicula  Salomonis 3  and  refers  to  it  by  the  same  title,  following  D  and  M  that \ngive  the  title  Little  key  ( Clavicula  in  Latin)  to  the  text.  On  the  other  hand,  the \ntitle  Epistle  to  Rehoboam,  not  supported  by  the  manuscripts,  was  extensively \nused  by  Scott  Carroll,  who  was  trying  to  incorporate  the  text  within  the \ncorpus  of  the  Old  Testament  Pseudepigrapha.4  Finally,  Greek  scholars,  such \nas  Politis  and  Bees,  often  use  the  common  Greek  title  Solomônikè,  simply \nmeaning  \"Solomonic\",  again  not  supported  by  the  manuscripts,  but  based  on \nGreek  folklore  convention.  As  mentioned  above,  this  word  came  to  indicate \nany  magical  and  diabolical  scripture  in  modem  Greek. \n\nConceming  the  similarities  with  the  Key  of  Solomon,  except  for  the  title \nLittle  Key,  it  seems  that  the  introduction  has  been  redacted  to  form  different \nintroductory  passages  in  several  instances.  Thus,  Solomon's  initial \nexhortation  to  Rehoboam,  the  subséquent  question  of  the  latter  and  the \nanswer  of  the  first,  hâve  survived  in  a  somewhat  different  form  in  the  Add. \nMS  10862  text  of  the  Key  of  Solomon.5  Moreover,  it  seems  that  Chapter  1  of  the \nRabbi  Solomon  Family  (RSF)  of  texts  of  the  Key  of  Solomon  starts  with  a  very \nsimilar  exhortation.6 \n\n2.  Talismans  attributed  to  the  planetary  hours  or  to  the  seven  days  ofthe  week \n\nVariants  of  this  section  exist  in  H,  P,  D,  M,  A,  G  and  P3.  In  M,  G  and  P3 \nthe  section  consists  of  seven  tables,  describing  the  attribution  of  the  hours  of \nthe  week  to  the  seven  planets.

The  day  starts  with  sunrise,  so  the  hour \nbeginning  with  Sunday's  sunrise  belongs  to  the  Sun.  The  next  hours  are \nattributed,  in  their  tum,  to  Venus,  Mercury,  the  Moon,  Satum,  Jupiter  and \nMars.  When  the  cycle  ends,  the  attributions  start  again  from  the  Sun  and  so \non.  The  day  has  twelve  planetary  hours,1  as  well  as  the  night,  so,  with  the \nexception  of  the  two  equinoxes,  the  hours  of  the  day  and  those  of  the  night \nare  uneven. \n\nAdjacent  to  each  hour  is  the  effects  one  may  cause,  if  one  constructs  a \ntalisman  during  this  spécifie  hour.  The  logic  of  these  talismans  is  usually \ncombinative.  For  instance.  Venus  traditionally  per  tains  to  operations \nregarding  love,  while  Satum  is  often  attributed  to  operations  aiming  to  harm. \nThus,  a  talisman  made  during  the  fourth  hour  of  Friday,  which  has  Venus  as \na  ruler  of  the  day,  and  Satum  as  a  ruler  of  the  hour,  will  prevent  love \nbetween  two  persons. \n\nIn  P,  D  and  A  this  chapter  is  missing,  being  replaced  with  a  short  version \nregarding  operations,  or  talismans,  suitable  for  each  day  of  the  week.  This \nconcludes  with  a  paragraph  that  divides  the  seven  planets  into  benefic, \nmalign  and  those  of  a  mixed  nature.  H  cites  both  versions,  adding  the  long \none  as  an  independent  section  after  the  end  of  the  text. \n\nThe  prototype  for  both  the  long  and  short  versions  seems  to  be  a  short \nindependent  work  on  electional  astrology  by  Hêliodôros,  an  astrologer  of  the \n4th  century  CE,  and  consultant  of  the  Emperor  Valens.2  This  work  is \npreserved  in  N,  divided  into  two  separate  chapters.  The  first  one  gives  the \nmethod  of  discovering  which  planet  rules  at  each  hour  and  also  includes  the \nclassification  of  the  planets  into  benefic,  malign,  and  mixed.  The  second  one \ncites  the  actions  one  must  do  during  each  hour.  This  work  of  Hêliodôros  will \nhâve  been  altered  by  the  author  of  the  Treatise,  in  order  to  fit  his  talismanic \npursuits.  If  this  is  true,  then  it  may  also  be  an  indication  for  dating  the \nMagical  Treatise  later  than  the  4th  century  CE. \n\nFour  of  the  days  of  the  week  are  named  by  ordinal  numbers:  Monday  is \nDeutera,  the  Second;  Tuesday  is  Tritë,  the  Third;  Wednesday  is  Tetartê,  the \nFourth;  and  Thursday  is  Pemptë,  the  Fifth.  Friday  is  named  Paraskeuë,  the \nPréparation,  and  Saturday  is  Sabbaton,  the  Sabbath.  This  nomenclature  led \nTorijano  to  point  to  a  Jewish  origin.3  However,  Sunday  is  named  Kyriakë,  the \nLord's  day.

          "text": "49 \n\nThe  Magical  Treatise  of  Solomon \n\n3.  The  prayers  ofthe  planets \n\nVariants  of  this  section  exist  in  H,  P,  T,  D,  M,  A,  G,  P2,  P4,  B,  A2,  and  B3. \nIn  M  this  section  continues  to  describe  the  method  of  talisman  construction. \nThe  introductory  paragraph  counsels  that  after  one  has  found  the  most \ndésirable  hour  for  one's  purpose,  then  one  has  to  recite  the  prayer  of  the \nplanet  that  rules  the  day.  Then  follows  a  sériés  of  seven  short  planetary \nprayers.  These  prayers  are  addressed  to  God,  followed  by  the  conjurations  of \nthe  planets.  The  latter  include  some  magical  planetary  names.  The  same  set \nof  prayers  are  included  in  B,  P4  and  A2.  Manuscript  D  cites  only  the \nintroductory  paragraph  and  the  text  stops  at  that  point.  The  following  folios \nare  blank.  T  cites  the  prayer  of  the  Sun  immediately  after  the  introduction \nand  the  text  stops  at  that  point. \n\nH  cites  another  sériés  of  longer  planetary  prayers  with  different  magical \nnames.  P  uses  the  longer  version  of  H,  cited  as  an  independent  text.  In  fact, \nthe  prayers  were  written  by  the  original  15*  century  scribe,  Meidiatës,  while \nthe  rest  of  the  Treatise  was  added  into  some  blank  folios  by  a  16th  century \nhand.  Manuscript  A  interestingly  includes  both  sériés  of  planetary  prayers. \nThe  redactor  instructs  one  to  use  the  short  version  before  constructing  the \nplanetary  talisman  and  the  long  one  while  censing  it.  B3  uses  both  versions \nagain,  but  without  any  explanation.  G,  on  the  other  hand,  présents  only  one \nsériés,  but  uses  the  long  version  for  the  prayers  of  Satum  and  Jupiter,  the \nshort  version  for  the  prayers  of  the  Sun  and  the  Moon,  and  a  composition  of \nthe  two  versions  for  the  prayers  of  Mars,  Venus  and  Mercury.  P2  generally \nuses  the  short  version,  with  the  exception  of  Satum. \n\nTorijano  argues  that  the  prayers  are  adapted  from  a  pagan  source,  since \nthe  planets  are  considered  as  actual  divinities  with  certain  attributes.1 \nHowever,  if  one  looks  carefully  at  these  attributes,  it  is  évident  that  they  are \npurely  astrological  and  hâve  nothing  to  do  with  the  pagan  gods.  For  instance, \nthe  healing  power  of  the  planet  Jupiter  was  not  really  an  attribute  of  the  god \nZeus.  The  planets  are  not  the  récipients  of  the  prayers,  but  natural  forces \nconjured  by  the  power  of  the  One  God,  whether  Christian,  Jewish  or \nNeoplatonic.  Torijano's  belief  affects  his  translation,  since  he  just  transcribes \nthe  Greek  names  of  the  seven  planets,  treating  them  as  gods,  rather  than \ntranslating  them  into  the  Latin  équivalents  commonly  used  for  the  planets  in \nEnglish. \n\n1  Torijano,  Solomon  the  Esoteric  King,  p.  168.\n"

          "text": "50 \n\nThe  Magical  Treatise  of  Solomon \n\n4.  General  information  conceming  the  signs  ofthe  Zodiac \n\nThis  section  exists  in  H  and  G.  A  similar  text  may  be  recognized  in  the \nseverely  destroyed  folios  1-lv  of  A.  The  section  describes  the  names  and \nsymbols  of  the  twelve  signs,  how  long  the  Sun  and  the  Moon  remains  in  each \nof  them,  a  practical  method  of  calculating  the  sign  where  the  Moon  is  at  any \ngiven  time,  and  their  division  into  benefic,  malign  and  mixed.  In  the  end \nthere  are  instructions  regarding  the  time  when  a  zodiacal  talisman  should  be \nconstructed.  The  text  of  G  is  more  extended  than  H  and  it  is  interrupted  by  a \npassage  about  the  celestial  dragon.  In  addition  to  the  previous  information,  it \nincludes  the  dates  when  the  Sun  changes  Sign,  the  planetary  rulers  of  the \nSigns,  the  friendships  and  enmities  between  the  planets  and  a  division  of  the \nSigns  into  cardinal,  fixed  and  mutable.  This  chapter  was  probably  inserted \ninto  ail  three  sources  from  an  independent  astrological  work.  It  has  a  certain \nrôle  in  H  and  A,  where  information  on  the  Zodiacal  talismans  follow,  but  it \nseems  irrelevant  in  G. \n\n5.  Talismans  attributed  to  the  twelve  signs  ofthe  Zodiac \n\nThis  section  exists  in  N,  H,  P,  A,  P3  and  B3.  It  contains  information  about \nthe  powers  that  each  Sign  can  bestow  on  a  spécifie  talisman  made  of \nparchment.  It  can  be  found  in  N  as  an  independent  text,  as  it  probably \noriginally  was.  Delatte  was  confident  that  the  angelic  names  of  the  twelve \nSigns  were  original  parts  of  the  Treatise  as  well.1  However,  the  angelic  names \nof  the  Signs  only  appear  in  P3  and  P4  independently  from  this  section. \n\n6.  Talismans  attributed  to  the  days  ofthe  Moon \n\nThis  section  exists  in  A,  P3  and  B.  It  contains  information  about  the  powers \nwhich  each  of  the  twenty  nine  days  of  the  Moon  can  grant  to  a  talisman.  Some \ndays,  however,  are  not  attributed  to  talismans,  but  to  certain  magical  operations. \nIts  source  of  inspiration  may  hâve  been  some  kind  of  lunarium.  Such  an  example \nof  an  independent  lunarium  can  be  found  in  N.  P3  cites  another  version  that \nincludes  the  angelic  and  demonic  names  attributed  to  the  days  of  the  Moon.  B \ncites  both  versions.  Unfortunately,  in  this  second  version,  P3  stops  at  the \neleventh  and  B  at  the  fourteenth  day  of  the  Moon. \n\n1  Delatte  (ed.),  Le  traité  des  Plantes  Planétaires,  p.  150. \n\nThe  Magical  Treatise  of  Solomon \n\n7.  An  eledional  astrology  passage  conceming  the  position  ofthe  Moon  in  the  Zodiac \n\nVariants  of  this  section  can  be  found  in  H,  A,  P3  and  B.  H  and  A  preserve \nthe  first  version  incomplète,  as  if  the  scribes  realized  its  irrelevancy  after  they \nhad  copied  some  of  it  first.  Manuscript  A  reaches  to  Léo  and  H  to  Capricorn. \nMoreover,  in  H  this  section  is  placed  after  the  end  of  the  Treatise.  P3 \npréserves  a  second  version.  B  contains  both. \n\nTwo  relevant  but  different  works  of  this  kind  can  be  found  in  N  and  P. \nThe  work  contained  in  N  is  attributed  to  \"a  Persian  philosopher,  named \nZanatës\".  In  fact,  he  is  Abu  'Abdallah  Muhammad  al-Zanati,  not  a  Persian, \nbut  a  North  African  master  of  geomancy  who  lived  in  the  12*  or  13*  century. \nOther  works  of  al-Zanati  survive  in  M,  N,  B2  and  V.  Some  of  his  works  were \ntranslated  into  Greek  by  the  monk  Arsenios  in  1266.1  Similar  independent \nworks  can  be  found  in  the  Greek  magical  papyri: \n\nOrbit  of  the  Moon:  Moon  in  Virgo:  anything  is  rendered  obtainable.  In  Libra: \nnecromancy.  In  Scorpio:  anything  inflicting  evil.  In  Sagittarius:  an  invocation  or \nincantations  to  the  sun  and  moon.  In  Capricorn:  say  whatever  you  wish  for  best \nresults.  In  Aquarius:  for  a  love  charm.  Pisces:  for  foreknowledge.  In  Aries:  fire \ndivination  or  love  charm.  In  Taurus:  incantation  to  a  lamp.  Gemini:  spell  for \nwinning  favour.  In  Cancer:  phylacteries.  Léo:  rings  or  binding  spells.2 \n\nAnother  work  conceming  the  position  of  the  Moon  in  the  zodiac  is \nincluded  in  the  ACF  text  variants  of  the  Key  of  Solomon .3 \n\n8.  The  rule  ofthe  head  and  the  tail  ofthe  dragon \n\nThis  section  is  an  electional  astrology  passage  inserted  in  the  text  of  A \nand  B.  It  explains  that  the  head  of  the  dragon  (Caput  Draconis)  rules  from  the \nfirst  hour  of  Saturday  night  until  the  twelfth  hour  of  Sunday,  while  the  tail \n(Cauda  Draconis)  rules  from  the  first  hour  of  Sunday  night  until  the  twelfth \nhour  of  Monday.  The  author  advises  not  to  travel  during  those  times. \n\n9.  Prédictions  related  to  the  dragon \n\nThis  section  exists  in  A,  B  and  G.  It  is  again  an  astrological  passage, \ninserted  in  A  and  B  immediately  after  the  previous  one,  due  to  their  relevancy. \nHowever,  in  G  it  is  abbreviated  and  inserted  in  the  midst  of  the  general \n\n1  Skinner,  Terrestrial  Astrology;  Divination  by  Geomancy,  pp.  16  and  32-33. \n\n2  Betz  (ed.),  The  Greek  Magical  Papyri  in  Translation,  p.  124.

In \nA,  the  images  of  Jupiter  and  Mars  are  drawn  besides  the  text  (see  Figure  36). \nB  has  only  the  image  of  Jupiter. \n\nThe  proper  time  for  their  construction  is  the  day  and  hour  when  the \nappropriate  planet  rules,  while  the  Sun  and  the  Moon  must  be  in  Signs  ruled \nby  the  same  planet.  The  metals  attributed  to  the  planets  are  the  usual  ones, \nwith  the  exception  of  Mercury,  which  is  attributed  to  cast  bronze.  Magical \nnames  are  to  be  engraved  upon  the  image  with  the  knife  of  the  art  and  then \nthe  whole  must  be  censed  with  appropriate  incenses.  The  last  paragraph \ninstructs  that  before  the  construction  one  must  first  recite  the  planetary \nprayer  and  then  the  conjuration  of  the  angel  and  the  démon  of  the  hour. \n\n11.  Conjuration  oftheangels \n\nThis  section  appears  in  H,  P,  M,  A,  G,  P2,  P4,  B  and  A2,  while  B3  cites  it \nthree  times.  By  the  power  of  God  one  conjures  the  angels  who,  in  their  tum, \nare  asked  to  subdue  the  démons  under  the  conjurer's  will  and  make  the \noperation  effective.  The  conjuration  is  the  same  in  ail  cases,  but  the  conjurer \nhas  to  supply  it  with  the  proper  angelic  and  demonic  names.  P  omits  the \nconjuration,  saying  that  one  has  just  to  recite  the  angelic  names. \n\n12.  Prayer  to  God  Almighty \n\nThis  prayer  appears  in  G,  P2  and  P4.  It  might  be  an  irrelevant  prayer \ninserted  in  G  and  P4  with  the  instruction  that  one  must  recite  it  before  every \nother  operation.  The  same  instruction  is  given  in  P2.  Note  that  in  P2  it  is  not  a \n\n1  Delatte  (ed.),  Anecdota  Atheniensia,  p.  3.\n"

The  same  thing  happens  in  A,  which  in  a \ngeneral  instruction  after  the  planetary  prayers  says: \n\nBut  before  conjuring  the  names  of  the  planets,  conjure  the  planetary  angels \n\nSakatiël  and  Ktënoël,  as  well  as  the  démons  Alëdëpôr  and  Klëdatôr. \n\nThese  are  the  angels  and  démons  of  Satum  contained  in  the  short  list.  It  is  obvious \nthat  ail  short  liste  appeared  in  the  same  way,  before  actually  being  organized  in  a \nspécial  chapter  and  embdlishing  the  long  ones. \n\nRegarding  the  origin  of  those  names  a  few  things  can  be  said.  In  the  vast \nmajority  of  cases  they  do  not  appear  in  older  sources,  but  a  few  exceptions  do \nexist.  As  Greenfield  notices,  the  démon  Omias  from  the  Testament  of  Solomon \nreappears  in  the  long  list  as  Ornai ;  Asmodaios  appears  as  Asmodai ;  Kynopëgos \nas  Kinopigos;  and  Sphandôr  as  Spondôr.  Two  names  remain  the  same  in  the  two \n\n1  Greenfield,  Traditions  of  Belief,  pp.  223-224.  Despite  the  fact  that  the  two  lists  share  but  one \ndemonic  name,  Tartarouel,  which  does  not  even  appear  on  the  same  day,  there  seems  to  be  a \ndistant  relationship  between  the  long  and  the  short  list  that  can  be  supported  by  the  angelic \nnames.  The  names  Mikhaêl,  Gabriel,  Rhaphaël  and  Agathouël  appear  in  both  lists  on  the \nsame  day,  and  there  are  some  other  corrélations  as  well.\n"

          "text": "74 \n\nThe  Magical  Treatise  of  Solomon \n\ntexts,  namely  Tephra  and  Ephippas) \n\nIn  the  analysis  of  Section  2  we  saw  that  in  ail  probability  the  Treatise \nshould  be  regarded  as  later  than  the  4th  century  CE.  This  section  points  to  a \nconsiderably  later  date.  The  main  reason  is  the  name  of  the  chief  démon  of \nWednesday,  Loutzipher  or  Loutzëpher.  It  is  obvious  that  both  variants  are  but \ntranslitérations  of  the  Latin  name  Lucifer ,  the  light  bearer,  in  its  Italian \npronunciation.  A  Greek  of  the  early  Middle  Ages  would  never  use  the  Latin \nname,  since  the  Greek  équivalent,  Eôsphoros,  had  been  long  established \nthrough  the  Septuagint  translation  of  the  Old  Testament,  the  Patristic \nliterature  and  the  liturgical  language.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  Italian \ninfluence  is  évident  in  the  vocabulary  of  other  parts  of  the  Treatise,  as  well.1 2 \n\nTorijano  proposes  Southern  Italy  as  the  place  of  the  composition  of  the \nTreatise  in  order  to  explain  the  Italian  influence,3  and  this  is  a  plausible \ntheory.  It  then  would  hâve  been  composed  at  some  time  between  the  6‘h  and \nthe  11 th  centuries,  folio wing  the  Gothic  War  that  placed  Southern  Italy  under \nthe  rule  of  the  Eastem  Empire  and  before  the  Norman  conquest.  However, \nanother  plausible  theory  is  that  it  could  hâve  been  composed  later  in  Crete, \nduring  the  13th  or  14th  century,  that  is  to  say  under  Venetian  rule. \n\nIn  fact,  the  Cretan- Venetian  theory  is  more  probable,  considering  three \nfactors:  a)  from  the  Gothic  War  until  the  Norman  conquest,  Southern  Italy \nwas  constantly  plunged  in  war  between  the  Lombards,  the  Byzantine  Empire \nand  the  Islamic  Caliphate,  while  under  the  Venetian  rule  Crete  was \nblooming,  to  the  point  that  we  can  speak  of  a  \"Cretan  Renaissance\";  b)  the \nstudy  of  astrology  and  related  subjects  was  strongly  suppressed  by  the \nchurch  during  the  early  Middle  Ages,4  while  the  Venetian  rulers  in  the  high \nMiddle  Ages  were  generally  tolérant;  c)  Crete  has  a  strong  tradition  of  occult \nlore,  such  as  évocation  and  the  use  of  magical  black  handled  knives,  as  will \nbe  shown  in  the  analysis  of  the  relevant  section. \n\nMcCown  argues  that  the  Treatise  was  known  earlier  than  the  13*  century  in \nByzantium,  since  the  historian  Nicetas  Chômâtes  mentions  a  Solomonic  book \nfound  in  the  possession  of  the  magician  Isaac  Aaron  at  Constantinople,  in  1172. \nBy  means  of  this  book,  a  sorcerer  could  summon  démons  in  légions,  in  order  to \nperforai  various  tasks.  However,  this  description  does  not  solely  fit  the  Treatise. \n\n1  Greenfield,  Traditions  ofBelief,  pp.  224-225. \n\n2  Of  course,  there  is  always  the  possibility  that  the  name  Loutzipher  is  but  a  late  addition  to  the \noriginal  Greek  text.  But  as  it  occurs  in  ail  the  surviving  long  lists,  this  possibility  is  very  small. \n\n3  Torijano,  Solomon  the  Esoteric  King,  pp.  160, 170  and  174. \n\n4  Barton,  Ancient  Astrology,  pp.  78-83.\n"

Planetary  incenses,  characters  and  seals \n\nThis  chapter  exists  in  versions  H,  A,  P2,  P4,  B  and  four  times  in  B3.  It \ncontains  instructions  for  the  manufacture  of  seven  composite  incenses,  one \nfor  each  planet.  Every  planetary  incense  is  followed  by  the  planetary \ncharacters,  intended  to  be  written  on  the  planetary  talismans.  Then  follows  a \nplanetary  seal,  one  for  each  planet  again.  The  actual  différence  between  the \ncharacters  and  the  seal  is  explained  only  in  B,  which  reads,  in  a  rather \nrépétitive  style: \n\nThe  characters  must  be  written  on  the  talisman,  but  the  seal  must  be  written \noutside.  The  seal  must  be  written  on  the  talisman  when  it  is  folded.  The  seals \nmust  be  written  outside  the  talisman  not  only  regarding  this  planet,  but  as \nregards  ail  seven.  Write  the  seal  on  the  talisman  when  you  fold  it. \n\n15.  Planetary  alphabets \n\nThe  section  on  the  planetary  alphabets  can  be  found  in  A,  P4,  B  and \ntwice  in  B3.  It  contains  four  instead  of  seven  alphabets,  since  two  planets  can \nshare  one  alphabet.  Thus,  Mars  and  Saturn,  as  malign,  share  the  same \nalphabet.  The  same  happens  with  Venus  and  Moon,  as  benefic  planets,  and \nwith  Mercury  and  Sun,  as  planets  of  a  mixed  nature.  Interestingly,  Jupiter \nhas  his  own  alphabet,  despite  the  fact  that  it  is  also  benefic  like  Venus  and \nthe  Moon.  According  to  the  text,  one  must  write  the  purpose  of  the  operation \non  the  talisman,  using  the  appropriate  alphabet. \n\n16.

The  first  tradition,  which  seems  to  be  the  oldest, \nis  preserved  in  M,  A,  P3  and  twice  in  B3.

There  are  several \nworks  on  the  planetary  herbs  included  in  the  various  manuscripts.  In  fact, \nDelatte  speaks  about  five  different  works  on  planetary  plants,1  but  only  four \nof  them  can  be  found  in  Greek  and  only  two  can  be  convincingly  connected \nto  the  Magical  Treatise. \n\nThe  first  work,  irrelevant  to  the  Treatise,  can  be  found  in  both  long  and \nshort  versions,  of  which  the  short  is  attested  in  N  and  the  long  in  B2  and  M2. \nThe  latter  two  manuscripts  attribute  this  work  to  Alexander  the  Great. \nAnother  manuscript  that  supports  the  short  version  is  Vindobonensis  Phil \nGr.  179  (edited  in  Catalogus  VI  p.  83),  while  the  long  one  appears  also  in \nErglangensis  89  (edited  in  Catalogus  VII  p.  233).  Parisinus  Gr.  2256,  Venetus \nApp.  cl.V.13  and  Mosquensis  415  includes  the  long  version  immediately  after \nthe  second  work.  A  critical  édition  of  these  three  manuscripts  is  included  in \nCatalogus  VIII  3,  pp.  153-165. \n\nThis  first  work  survives  in  The  Book  of  Secrets  of  Albertus  Magnus,  where  it \nis  also  attributed  to  Alexander  the  Great.2  Some  of  the  names  are  changed \nthough,  such  as  the  peculiar  chynostates  instead  of  kynosbatos,  the  caper,  and \nthe  corrupt  acharonis,  interpreted  as  henbane,  instead  of  sakkharon,  the \nsugarcane.  This  list  of  seven  herbs  is  copied  by  Cornélius  Agrippa,  who \nattributes  it  to  Hermes  Trismegistus.3  Agrippa  continues  to  ascribe  the \nhenbane  to  Jupiter,  but  kynosbatos  is  read  here  as  chencrpodium,  the  goosefoot. \nIt  should  be  noted  here  that  the  Greek  word  kynosbatos  (dog  thom)  was  used \nfor  several  plants,  including  the  caper,  the  evergreen  rose,  the  bramble  or  the \nyew.  The  caper  is  preferred  because  of  an  explanatory  marginal  note  in \nVenetus  App.  cl.V.13  \"this  is  the  caper.\" \n\nThe  second  work,  irrelevant  to  the  Treatise,  is  included  again  in  Parisinus \nGr.  2256,  Venetus  App.  cl.V.13  and  Mosquensis  415,  as  well  as  in  Parisinus \nGr.  2502  and  Parisinus  Gr.  1603.  It  is  attributed  to  Hermes  Trismegistus.  Its \nattributions  also  appear  in  Agrippa's  Occult  Philosophy,  immediately  before \nthe  previous  list,  probably  taken  again  from  Apuleius  Platonicus.  One \ndifférence  from  the  Greek  original  is  that  Agrippa  ascribes  the  marigold  to \nthe  Sim,  whereas  the  Greek  list  ascribes  chicory  instead. \n\nThe  third  work  appears  in  H,  P2  and  twice  in  B3.

          "text": "81 \n\nThe  Magical  Treatise  of  Solomon \n\nredactor  of  P2  has  transformed  the  Magical  Treatise  into  a  Treatise  on  the \nplanetary  herbs.  A  characteristic  of  the  third  work  is  the  tradition  regarding \nthe  herb  of  the  Sun  called  augia ,  the  \"shiny  herb.\"  Although  resembling  the \nsun  spurge  from  the  fourth  work,  at  least  according  to  P2,  it  is  very  distinct \nfrom  it,  since  \"It  is  not  possible  to  be  found  except  at  night,  when  it  shines \nbrightly.  It  is  found  by  a  sieve  arsëmiou,1  a  bow  and  an  arrow.\" \n\nAnother  name  for  this  shiny  herb  from  B3,  as  well  as  from  the  Greek \nfolklore,  is  lampëdona.  Nikolaos  Politis  informs  us  about  this  tradition, \noffering  an  explanation  regarding  the  use  of  the  bow  and  the  arrow.  One \napparently  has  to  mark  the  herb  from  far  away,  otherwise  the  shine  ceases  to \nexist.  The  use  of  the  sieve  still  remains  a  puzzle. \n\nAt  the  tops  of  the  high  mountains  there  is  a  herb,  the  lampëdona .  It  cannot  be \nseen  at  daylight  and  nobody  can  recognize  it  among  the  other  plants,  but  at \nnight  it  gleams  and  shines,  and  it  can  be  seen  from  far  away.  But  if  somebody \napproaches  in  order  to  uproot  it,  the  shine  stops  and  it  cannot  be  distinguished \nfrom  the  other  herbs.2 \n\nThis  tradition  dates  from  at  least  the  lst  century  CE,  since  it  can  be  traced \nback  to  The  Jezvish  War  of  Josephus: \n\nIn  the  ravine  that  protects  the  town  on  the  north  is  a  place  called  Baaras,  where \ngrows  a  root  of  the  same  name.  This  is  flame-coloured,  and  at  dusk  it  sends  out \nbrilliant  f lashes  so  that  those  who  corne  near  in  the  hope  of  plucking  it  cannot \ntake  hold  of  it,  as  it  slips  away  and  will  not  stay  still  until  it  is  drenched  with  a \nwoman's  urine  or  menstrual  blood,3 \n\nFinally,  a  similar  tradition  can  be  found  in  the  work  of  Claudius \nAelianus  On  the  Nature  of  Animais. \n\nThe  name  of  the  herb  is  ki/nospastos  and  it  is  also  called  aglaophôtis  (I  record  it \nbecause  it  is  my  duty).  This  escapes  the  notice  of  people  during  daylight  and  it \ncannot  be  seen  at  ail.  But  it  appears  and  shines  at  night  like  a  star,  because  it  is \nflame-like  and  resembles  fire.  So,  people  bed  a  sign  near  its  root  and  leave  it, \nbecause  if  they  forget  to  do  this,  they  cannot  recognize  either  its  colour  or  its \nform.  And  when  the  night  passes,  they  corne  and  see  the  sign  they  left,  and \nrecognize  the  herb.4 \n\nIt  may  seem  that  the  first  and  third  works  hâve  some  similarities.  For \n\n1  A  corrupt  word,  that  can  be  found  in  both  H  and  P3.  It  may  be  read  as  mpirsimiou ;  “silken.” \nThis  reading  is  supported  by  H,  where  another  word  for  “silken”  appears  also  as  a \ndeterminative  for  the  word  “sieve”. \n\n2  Politis,  Paradoseis ;  vol.

But  the  name  of  the \nherb  is  the  only  similarity,  as  the  content  is  totally  different.  The  same  is  valid \nfor  the  cinquefoil.  Also,  P2  gives  a  double  name  to  the  herb  of  Jupiter  and \nprésents  the  sugarcane  as  an  alternative,  using  the  peculiar  form  alkharanios. \nThe  Greek  word  for  the  sugarcane  is  sakkhar,  sakkhari,  sakkharis  and  sakkharon, \naccording  to  the  Liddell-Scott  Greek  English  Lexicon.  However,  in  the \nmanuscripts  it  appears  in  quite  corrupt  forms: \n\nSakharônê  in  Mosquensis  415. \n\nSagkharônion  in  Parisinus  2256  and  Venetus  App.  cl.  V.  13. \n\nSakkharanion  in  Erglanensis  89. \n\nAlkharanios  in  N,  Vindobonensis  Phil.  Gr.  179  and  P2. \n\nAkhronios  in  M2. \n\nFrom  this  list  one  can  imagine  that  the  redactor  of  P2  must  hâve  read  the \nfirst  work  from  a  manuscript  where  this  word  already  existed  in  a  corrupt \nState.  It  had  become  so  unrecognizable,  that  he  assumed  it  was  an  alternative \nform  of  the  garden  orache,  the  herb  of  Jupiter  appearing  in  his  main  source. \n\nThe  fourth  work  appears  in  M  and  G.  Version  G  mentions  the  herbs  of \nSun  and  Moon  only,  but  although  the  paragraph  of  G  about  the  Sun  spurge  is \nquite  identical  to  M,  the  one  about  the  peony  follows  a  totally  different \ntradition.  It  is  a  summary  from  an  independent  work  on  peony,  found  in \nCodex  Vaticanus  Gr.  952.  Delatte  believes  that  this  fourth  work  is  something \nbetween  the  second  and  the  third  works.  However,  its  similarities  with  the \nsecond  work  are  confined  in  three  of  four  lines  in  the  case  of  the  Sun  and \neven  less  in  the  cases  of  Venus  and  Mercury.  Its  similarities  with  the  third \nwork  are  more  obvious. \n\nThe  fifth  work  Delatte  mentions  is  Latin  and  ascribed  to  Flaccus  Africus \nor  Africanus.  The  planetary  attributions  of  the  seven  planets  are  generally \nmissing,  but  one  manuscript  includes  five  of  them.  Delatte  proposes  an \nattribution  for  the  other  two.  This  work  is  irrelevant  to  the  Treatise,  and  its \nplanetary  correspondences  are  included  in  the  table  simply  for  reasons  of \ncomparison.\n"

Rashi,  commenting  on  a  Talmudic  passage,  says: \n\nHe  who  is  particular  about  the  vessel  (by  means  of  which  he  divines),  that  he \ncannot  do  anything  without  the  vessel  that  is  required  for  that  thing,  as,  for \ninstance,  the  \"princes  of  the  thumb\",  for  which  they  require  a  knife,  the  handle \nof  which  is  black,  or  the  \"princes  of  the  cup\",  that  they  require  a  cup  of  glass.1 \n\nRashi  is  here  describing  a  \"thumb  nail\"  divination,  an  onykhomanteia, \nwhich  is  preserved  in  many  posterior  Greek  and  Hebrew  manuscripts  and \n\n1  Daiches,  Babylonian  Oil  Magic,  p.  30.\n"

In  this  text,  Beelzeboul  says: \n\nTake  f if ty  one  in  number  black  unbom  kids,  bring  me  a  new  knife  with  a  handle \nmade  f orm  black  hom  and  attached  by  three  rivets,  and  skin  the  kids.1 \n\nTraditions  conceming  the  black  handled  knife  and  its  magical \nconnections  still  survive  in  Greece,  mainly  in  Crete,  where  such  knives  with \nhandles  made  of  black  he-goat  horns  are  still  manufactured.  Nikolaos  Politis \ncites  a  tradition  f  rom  Messara  in  1904: \n\nIf  somebody  wants  to  leam  how  to  play  well  the  Cretan  lyra ,  he  goes  at \nmidnight  to  a  deserted  crossroad.  He  traces  a  circle  on  the  ground  with  a  black \nhandled  knife,  enters  the  circle,  sits  down  and  plays.  Moments  later,  fairies \ncorne  from  every  direction  and  surround  him.  They  do  not  hâve  good \nintentions;  they  want  to  smite  him.  But  they  cannot  enter  the  circle,  since  it  is \ntraced  with  the  black  handled  knife,  so  they  try  to  seduce  him  and  draw  him  out.2 \n\nIt  seems  that  this  black  handled  knife  is  the  bane  of  spirits,  as  another \nstory  says: \n\nSomebody  was  going  to  Khrousa  with  a  friend  of  his.  In  some  place  they \nstopped  for  a  while  and  then  they  separated.  The  moment  they  separated, \nfairies  surrounded  him  and  they  were  talking  to  him.  He  did  not  understand \nwhat  they  were  saying,  but  he  had  heard  that  if  one  beds  a  black  handled  knife \ninto  the  ground,  they  leave.  Luckily,  he  had  such  a  knife,  he  bedded  it  into  the \nground  and  they  lef t.3 \n\nThe  black  handled  knife  is  mentioned  in  the  RSF  textual  variants  of  the \nKey  of  Solomon .  Its  construction  is  described  in  ACF,  but  it  is  different  from \nthe  process  mentioned  in  the  Greek  text.  The  construction  of  a  knife  or  sword \nof  the  art  is  also  described  in  the  Universal  Treatise  Family  (UTF)4  and  in  the \nGrimorium  Verum  (GV),5  but  there  is  no  description  of  it  as  black  handled.  It \nshould  be  noted,  however,  that  the  latter  work  notes  that  it  must  be  constructed \non  the  day  and  hour  of  Mars,  f ollowing  the  tradition  of  A,  B,  G  and  B3. \n\n1  McCown  (ed),  The  Testament  of  Solomon,  p.  108  for  the  dating;  p.  77*  for  the  passage.

But  I  théorisé  that  the  seven  reed  pens \nwere  originally  used  for  writing  the  planetary  talismans,  whereas  the  quill \nserved  for  writing  the  signs  on  the  garments  and  on  the  lamen.  If  this  is  true, \nthe  présent  section  is  misplaced  here  from  the  second  part  of  the  Treatise  that \npertains  to  évocation. \n\nAccording  to  G,  the  quill  must  be  constructed  from  a  goose  feather, \nwhile  H  allows  it  to  be  made  also  from  a  crow,  vulture  or  another  bird.  When \nsomeone  plucks  it,  he  has  to  recite  a  short  prayer.  Then,  it  has  to  be  pointed \nby  means  of  the  knife  of  the  art  and  washed  in  running  water.  G  instructs \nthat  the  names  recited  must  also  be  written  and  placed  inside  the  quill. \nInstructions  similar  but  not  identical  to  H  are  given  in  ACF  and  GV.1 2 \n\n22.  The  virgin  par chment \n\nAppearing  in  H,  P,  A,  G,  P4,  B  and  B3,  this  section  gives  instructions  about \nthe  manufacture  of  virgin  parchment.  Its  source  must  be  a  male  animal  \"that \nhas  not  suckled  yet\"  in  H  and  P,  while  in  A  and  B  it  is  \"a  suckling  lamb  or \nkid\".  This  animal  must  be  slaughtered  by  means  of  the  knife  of  the  art,  while \nreciting  a  short  prayer.  The  animal  is  then  to  be  flayed  and  its  skin  washed  in \nrunning  water  and  left  in  the  Sun  to  dry.  Finally,  the  skin  is  to  be  worked  with \nquick-lime.  Note  that  usually  the  scribes  forget  to  mention  a  step,  such  as \nworking  with  quick-lime  or  leaving  in  the  Sun,  but  this  gives  the  entire \nprocedure.  Similar  but  not  identical  procedures  are  followed  by  RSF,  ACF, \nUTF  and  GV? \n\nThe  phrase  \"that  has  not  suckled  yet\"  seems  to  be  a  mistake,  influenced \nby  the  section  conceming  the  unborn  parchment.  The  phrase  \"suckling  lamb \nor  kid\"  seems  to  be  the  correct  one.  This  section  expands  section  16,  where \nthe  planetary  parchments  hâve  been  explained. \n\n23.

It  may  be  an \nintrusion  from  other  magical  texts,  for  example  from  the  astrological \ntalismans  contained  in  M3,  as  they  do  contain  images  made  of  beeswax. \nAnother  use  of  the  virgin  wax  is  the  construction  of  the  ring  of  Solomon,  as \nwill  be  explained  below. \n\nThe  virgin  wax  has  to  be  collected  from  a  beehive  and  placed  in  the \nsanctuary  of  a  church  in  order  to  be  consecrated.

There  is  an \nouter  robe  (ektos  khitôri),  an  inner  tunic  (etitos  khitôniskos),  a  cloak  ( imation ) \nand  a  hose,  as  it  can  be  judged  both  from  context  and  etymology,  though  the \nword  used  (anaxieldia,  probably  from  anexia,  endurance  and  eldôr,  desire)  is \notherwise  unknown.  The  terminology  used  in  P  is  from  a  later  period,  but \ndescribes  the  same  set  of  clothes.  Here  there  is  also  a  cloak  (imation),  a  tunic \n(zoupounin)  and  a  hose  (kaltzes).  The  redactor  of  P  does  not  hâve  a  word  for \nthe  long  outer  robe,  an  anachronism  in  the  16*  century,  so  he  describes  it  as \n\"similar  to  a  woman's  dress\". \n\nThe  use  of  a  tunic  and  a  hose  does  not  offer  much  help  with  the  solution \nof  the  early  médiéval  Italy  versus  upper  médiéval  Crete  dilemma.  The \nwestern  influence  is  of  course  a  fact,  since  the  typical  Byzantine  costume \nincluded  a  long  inner  and  a  shorter  outer  robe.  Tunic  and  hose  were  adopted \nby  Cretans  under  the  Venetian  rule.  However,  they  were  common  in  Italy \nduring  the  early  Middle  Ages.

It  describes  the  manufacture  of  a \ncertain  lamen  named  ourania,  a  word  that  remains  untranslated  in  Delatte, \nGreenfiled  and  Torijano.  The  word  is  a  féminine  adjective  used  as  a  noun  and \ncan  be  translated  as  \"the  heavenly  one\"  or  \"the  celestial  one\".  In  ail \nprobability,  it  is  a  shortened  version  of  ourania  sphragis,  meaning  \"the \nheavenly  seal.\"  This  heavenly  seal  is  believed  to  protect  the  evoker  and  to \ngive  him  power  over  the  spirits,  when  he  wears  it,  fastened  with  twenty  two \nlacings.

Some  characters  are  to  be \nwritten  in  the  centre  of  the  scheme  and  some  more  inside  the  circles,  this  time \nwith  the  same  red  ink  used  for  the  signs  on  the  garments.  Not  one  of  the \nthree  versions  is  neatly  written.  The  crabbed  style  of  the  text  makes  it \nsomewhat  obscure. \n\nThe  tradition  about  the  lamen  as  a  major  instrument  of  the  art  is  a \ncommon  place  in  grimoires.  Different  seals,  used  as  lamens,  appear  in  Liber \nJuratus  Honorii,  as  \"the  seal  of  the  true  and  living  God\",  in  Heptameron,  as  the \n\"Pentacle\",  in  the  Lesser  Key  of  Solomon,  as  \"Solomon's  sexangled  figure\"1 \n(copying  the  Pentacle  of  the  Heptameron),  in  the  RSF  of  the  Key  of  Solomon  as \nthe  \"Great  Pentacle  of  Solomon\"  (copying  the  Heptameron  again)  and  in  UTF \nsimply  as  the  \"Pentacle\".2 \n\n34.  The  ring \n\nThe  section  conceming  the  ring  appears  in  H,  P,  A,  G,  B,  and  B3.  A,  B \nand  G  transposed  the  section  on  the  ring  to  the  end  of  the  first  part  of  the \nTreatise.  H  and  P  preserve  the  original  positioning  of  the  text.  The  ring  is \nmade  from  virgin  wax,  covered  by  virgin  parchment,  whereupon  various \nnomina  barbara  must  be  written.  Wearing  a  wax  ring  is  a  very  peculiar  idea,  so \nG  transmutes  it  to  a  totally  different  ring  made  from  cast  silver,  upon  whose \nbezel  some  characters  must  be  engraved  by  means  of  the  knife  of  the  art.  The \nring  is  to  be  worn  on  the  index  finger  of  the  right  hand. \n\nThis  section  is  of  course  influenced  by  the  Testament  of  Solomon,  where \nSolomon's  ring  appears  to  be  the  major  instrument  of  the  art.

          "text": "95 \n\nThe  Magical  Treatise  of  Solomon \n\n37.  The  prayer  and  the  three  conjurations  for  the  appearance  ofthe  spirits \n\nThis  section  exists  in  H,  B  and  twice  in  B3.  B  inserts  three  Psalms  before \nthe  actual  prayer,  namely  Psalm  121,  102  and  23  (KJV).  The  major  part  of  the \nprayer  consists  of  Hebrew  and  barbarous  names.  Then  follows  a  long \nconjuration  of  twelve  (in  H)  or  thirteen  (in  B  and  B3)  démons,  in  order  to \nfacilitate  their  appearance  in  visible  form.  Among  the  twelve  démons, \nLoutzipher,  Beelzeboul,  Asmedai  and  Mastraôth  (obviously  a  corrupt  form  of \nAstarôth)  are  mentioned,  something  that  indicates  that  originally  this  was  a \nconjuration  addressed  to  the  four  kings,  like  the  third  conjuration.  A  part  of \nthis  conjuration  has  a  distant  relationship  with  the  \"Third  Conjuration\"  of \nACF  (see  Table  11). \n\nThe  text  informs  us  that  after  this  conjuration  the  evoker  will  see  clouds \narising,  and  this  is  the  time  to  recite  a  short  second  conjuration,  in  order  to \nmake  the  démons  appear  in  a  human  and  not  a  monstrous  form. \n\nThe  third  conjuration,  according  to  H,  is  used  only  if  the  démons  delay \nto  approach  the  exorcist.  According  to  B,  however,  it  is  used  when  the \ndémons  are  approaching  the  circle.  In  any  case,  the  exorcist  touches  the \nlamen  with  his  right  hand,  his  left  pointing  towards  the  place  where  the \nspirits  are  heard,  and  recites  it.  This  conjuration  includes  a  long  sériés  of \nnomina  harhara  and  targets  the  four  kings  of  the  quarters:  Asmedai, \nLoutzipher,  Astarôth  and  Beelzeboul.  A  légion  of  démons  is  then  to  appear. \nThe  exorcist  must  first  ask  them  who  is  their  king.  Then,  he  must  make  them \nswear  obedience  on  their  king's  head.  Finally,  the  king  himself  must  swear \nobedience.  The  theme  of  the  four  kings  is  referred  to  in  passing  in  this  first \nmethod  of  évocation,  but  it  becomes  clearer  in  the  second  one. \n\n38.  Conjuration  for  love \n\nAfter  the  vow  is  given,  the  exorcist's  demands  can  be  of  two  kinds: \ndemands  for  love  and  demands  for  money.  This  section,  appearing  in  H  and \nB,  pertains  to  the  first.  The  demands  are  postulated  in  the  form  of  a  long \nconjuration. \n\n39.  Conjuration  for  a  treasure \n\nThis  section  appears  in  B,  twice  in  B3  and  partially  in  H,  which  cites  it \nincompletely.  By  means  of  this  long  conjuration,  the  exorcist  orders  the  four \nkings  of  the  quarters  to  bring  him  a  treasure.  With  this  conjuration  the  first \nmethod  of  évocation  cornes  to  an  end.  B  reads  on  this  point  \"The  end  of  this  art\".\n"

Observations,  fast,  garments  and  lamen \n\nExisting  in  H,  B  and  G,  this  section  describes  an  évocation  ritual  similar \nto  the  first  one,  H  distinguishes  this  method  from  the  previous,  entitling  it \nAnother  procedure  for  directing  the  spirits.  This  section  in  B  not  only  bears  the \ntitle  Behold  another  art,  but  inserts  an  introductory  paragraph,  stating  the \ndifférence  in  its  usual  répétitive  style: \n\nIt  does  not  resemble  the  first  one,  neither  in  the  procedure,  nor  in  the  lettering  of \nthe  names.  Study  them  both  and  use  the  procedure  you  want,  because  the  other \none  is  of  another  magister.  The  first  one  belongs  to  a  different  magister  from  the \nsecond.  There  are  also  other  différences,  cited  in  the  previous  pages.  Use  the \nmethod  you  prefer. \n\nThe  moral  rules  here  are  confined  to  sexual  abstinence  for  two  weeks, \nwhile  there  is  a  kind  of  fast  for  the  same  period.  However,  the  three  days  of \nstrict  fasting  with  water  and  bread  still  appear. \n\nThe  clothes  are  not  described  as  detailed  as  in  the  first  method.  H  speaks \nof  white  linen  tunic,  hose  (stockings)  and  shoes.  G  is  very  general  in  its \ndescription,  referring  just  to  white  linen  clothes  and  shoes,  while  B,  written \nthree  centuries  later  than  H,  describes  a  shirt,  culottes  (knee  Breaches),  socks \nand  shoes.  Instead  of  the  crown  made  from  virgin  parchment  that  appears  in \nthe  first  method,  there  is  a  piece  of  cloth  used  as  a  headdress,  maybe \nsomething  like  a  turban,  whereupon  certain  names  are  to  be  written.  Finally, \nthe  lamen  for  this  method  is  also  constructed  with  unbom  parchment  from  a \ncalf,  but  the  design  is  totally  different.  This  time  it  contains  twenty  four \nindependent  circular  seals  and  a  sériés  of  names. \n\n41.  The  circle \n\nThis  section  exists  in  H,  A,  G  and  B.  A  préserves  only  the  image  of  the \ncircle,  while  H  and  B  preserve  the  text  only.  Instructions  for  the  proper  place \nare  given,  as  well  as  for  the  proper  time,  which  is  the  same  as  in  the  first \nmethod.  Again,  the  manuscripts  mention  the  possibility  that  the  procedure \nfalls  at  night,  so  a  light  source  will  be  needed. \n\nAfter  the  bath,  the  exorcist  must  be  anointed  with  a  kind  of  perfume, \nscented  with  musk,  civet,  clove,  costus  and  water  milfoil.

The  main  part  of  them \nare  the  names  of  the  démons  attributed  to  the  four  quarters,  followed  by  a \nkind  of  a  simple  order,  like  \"corne,  corne,  corne,  do  not  delay,  wherever  you \nmay  be\".  It  is  not  very  clear  whether  the  evoker  must  recite  the  conjurations \nof  ail  four  quarters  in  tum,  or  choose  one  quarter  beforehand  and  deal  solely \nwith  it. \n\nIn  G  the  conjurations  for  the  East  and  the  North  are  missing.  There  is  a \ntorn  folio  between  the  figure  of  the  circle  on  folio  26v  and  the  conjuration  of \nthe  west  on  folio  27.  There  is  also  damage  in  A,  that  destroyed  the  names  of \nthe  south  and  partially  destroyed  the  ones  of  the  west.  Finally,  the  second \nversion  of  B3  does  not  contain  the  conjuration  of  the  east  and  it  is  generally \nso  corrupt  that  the  demonic  names  cannot  be  associated  with  the  other  lists, \nexcept  for  the  names  of  the  kings. \n\nConcerning  the  survival  of  the  four  démon  kings  in  later  grimoires,  such \nas  GV,  Peterson  remarks:  \"only  Asmodai  is  missing  from  the  list  of  the  'three \npowers'  in  GV.  Démons  of  the  four  winds  (north,  south,  east  and  west) \nbecome  solidified  into  distinct  geographical  directions  (Lucifer  in  Europe  and \nAsia,  Beelzebuth  in  Africa,  Astaroth  in  America)\".1  The  same  remarks  apply \nalso  to  the  UTV  family  of  the  Key,2  as  well  as  to  the  Grand  Grimoire.3 \n\nIn  fact,  a  somewhat  different  solidification  appears  in  B  as  well.  The \ndémons  of  the  west  are  clearly  connected  to  the  Southern  Balkans,  as  the \n\n1  Peterson  (ed.),  Grimorium  Verum,  p.  v. \n\n2  Skinner  and  Rankine  (eds.),  The  Véritable  Key  of  Solomon,  p.  373. \n\n3  Peterson  (ed.),  The  Grand  Grimoire.\n"

          "text": "99 \n\nThe  Magical  Treatise  of  Solomon \n\ndémons  of  the  east  are  connected  (not  so  clearly  in  this  case)  to  Asia  Minor.  It \nseems  that  the  scribe  lived  somewhere  in  between,  most  probably  in  some \nisland  of  the  Aegean  Sea.  The  démons  of  north  and  south  are  connected  to \nthe  (probably)  régional  names  Kountogou  and  Lotostan  respectively,  but  these \nnames  remain  unidentified. \n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  this  reference  to  the  four  kings  may  also  hâve  a \ndistant  relationship  with  the  Book  ofAbramelin.  In  the  latter  book  the  kings  are \nfour  as  well,  although  only  the  name  of  Lucifer  remains  the  same.  Yet,  the \nother  three  kings  of  the  Treatise  are  regarded  as  three  of  the  eight  Dukes, \ntogether  with  Magoth.1 \n\nGreenfield  notices  that  many  of  the  demonic  names  of  the  four  quarters \nare  taken  directly  from  the  Testament  of  Solomon.  Five  of  the  démons  of  the \nwest,  six  of  the  démons  of  the  north  and  one  of  the  démons  of  the  south  can \nbe  found  in  the  list  of  démons  of  the  decans  included  in  the  Testament,  while \nthree  of  the  démons  of  the  east  are  related  to  the  Seven  Evil  Sisters \nmentioned  therein.  Moreover,  three  other  démons  of  the  east  and  one  démon \nof  the  north  are  included  as  individual  démons  in  the  Testament.  Another \nsource  of  the  demonic  names  of  the  quarters  is  the  long  list  of  the  horary \ndémons  in  the  Treatise  itself,  since  at  least  three  names  are  repeated.2 \n\nIt  is  very  probable  that  each  cardinal  point  originally  had  the  same \nnumber  of  spirits,  most  likely  thirty.  However,  in  some  cases  two  names \nseem  to  hâve  been  joined  together  by  mistake,  while  in  other  cases  one  name \nhas  been  split  in  two.  It  is  impossible  to  discover  the  original  form  of  most  of \nthe  names.  The  comparative  lists,  with  the  exception  of  P4  and  the  second \nversion  of  B3,  are  presented  in  the  following  tables.3 \n\n1  Abraham  von  Worms,  The  Book  of  Abramelin,  p.  119. \n\n2  Greenfield,  Traditions  of  Relief,  pp.  227-229. \n\n3  Similar  tables  with  the  names  of  the  démons  in  Greek  letters  are  included  in  Greenfield, \nTraditions  ofBelief  pp.  347-350.\n"

They \nare  a  sériés  of  independent  operations,  such  as  a  spirit  binding,  two \névocations,  an  operation  for  invisibility  and  many  divinatory  methods, \nscattered  through  the  manuscripts.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  various  techniques \nare  numerous,  but  here  presented  only  if  appearing  in  at  least  two \nmanuscripts.  This  material  seems  to  be  older  than  the  Treatise,  since  in  the \ngreat  majority  of  the  operations  a  water  vessel  is  used,  as  in  the  various \ndivinations  of  the  Greek  Magical  Papyri. \n\n44.  Spirit  imprisoning  in  a  bottle  (Gasteromanteia) \n\nThis  method  exists  in  H,  A  and  P2.  H  and  P2  do  not  give  a  name  to  this \noperation.  In  H  the  purpose  of  this  operation  is  the  exorcism  of  a  possessing \ndémon  and  its  subséquent  imprisonment.  A  and  P2,  on  the  other  hand,  use \nthe  same  procedure  to  imprison  a  human  spirit  that  haunts  a  treasure. \nGasteromanteia  literally  means  \"bottle  divination,\"  but  it  is  obvious  that  in \nthis  context  no  divination  is  really  meant. \n\nA  new  bottle  is  placed  upon  a  table  with  a  new  tablecloth,  four  candies \nare  lit  and  incenses  are  burned,  namely  clove,  musk  and  galbanum.  Version \nA  adds  frankincense  as  well.  The  conjuration  recited  afterwards  aims  to \nimprison  the  spirit  or  démon  in  the  bottle.  When  the  virgin  boy  who  attends \nthe  ceremony  sees  the  spirit  in  the  bottle,  the  magister  seals  it  with  wax, \nwhereupon  a  magical  seal  is  engraved. \n\n45.  Evocation  ofthe  Lady  ofthe  Mountains \n\nThis  method  of  évocation  appears  in  B2  and  V.  The  evoker  must  go  to  a \nmountain  and  offer  honey  and  pine  kernels  to  the  'fairy  queen'  at  noon  on \nthe  lst  of  August.  She  will  appear,  grant  him  a  wish  and  make  his  horse  fast \nlike  an  eagle.  A  semi-monstrous  depiction  of  the  fairy  queen  is  included  in \nB2,  accompanying  the  instructions. \n\nThe  fairy  queen  is  actually  called  here  the  'Lady  of  the  Mountains'  or \n'Kalë  of  the  Mountains'.  The  name  Kalê,  which  means  'the  good-natured  one' \n(although  she  does  not  seem  to  be  good-natured  at  ail  times),  is  well\n"

Her \nbeauty  is  unearthly,  but  she  has  also  the  legs  of  an  ass  or  of  a  goat. \n\nIn  other  legends,  the  fairies  are  three.  If  someone  takes  something  from \nthem,  usually  a  head  handkerchief  or  a  ring,  they  obey  him  as  a  master,  teach \nhim  various  arts,  make  him  lucky  and  rich,  or  even  marry  him.2  Similar \ntraditions  conceming  the  fairy  Sibylia  and  her  two  sisters  are  preserved  in \nReginald  Scot's  Discoverie  of  Witchcraft.  They  are  conjured  to  appear  and \neither  be  the  sorcerer's  lovers,  or  give  him  the  ring  of  invisibility.  GV  cites  a \nsimilar  operation,  including  the  food  offering,  in  order  to  make  three  ladies \ncorne  to  one's  room,  teach  him  anything  he  wishes  to  know  and  finally  give \nhim  a  magical  ring  that  makes  him  win  at  gambling.3 \n\n46.  Evocation  of  the  black  démon \n\nThis  method  appears  in  B,  B2,  B3  and  partially  in  A.  Version  A  préserves \nthe  first  lines  only.  A  real  feast  is  offered  here,  since  the  evoker  offers  dried \nfruits,  nuts  and  incense  to  the  spirit,  as  in  the  évocation  of  Kalë,  mentioned \nabove.  A  magical  circle  is  to  be  traced  around  the  table  and  the  conjuration  to \nthe  black  démon,  that  is  to  say  to  Mourtzi,  is  then  recited.  When  he  cornes, \nthe  magister  must  thrust  the  knife  of  the  art  into  the  table.  The  black  démon \ncannot  go  away,  unless  the  knife  is  drawn  out.  Thus,  the  evoker  can \ninterrogate  him. \n\n47.  Water  pot  divination  (Epibaktromanteia) \n\nThis  method  appears  in  H,  A,  G,  P4  and  B.  The  conjuration  alone  can \nalso  be  found  in  B3.  It  must  be  noted  that  both  A  and  B  cite  two  somewhat \ndifferent  versions  of  this  method.4  The  water  pot  must  be  new  and  filled  with \nspring  water.  During  the  magister's  return  from  the  spring,  with  the  water \npot  filled,  he  must  not  look  behind  him  or  speak  with  anyone.  Then  he  traces \na  magical  circle  with  the  knife  of  the  art  and  repeats  certain  nomina  barbara  in \nthe  virgin  boy's  ear. \n\nThen  follows  a  conjuration  to  the  démons,  at  the  end  of  which  the \nmagister  asks  the  boy  if  he  sees  the  spirits  in  the  water  pot.

There  are  different  conjurations  for  the  récognition  of  a  thief,  for \nlearning  the  future,  for  news  about  émigrants,  for  locating  treasures  and  for \nleaming  somebody's  secrets.  Finally,  the  magister  banishes  the  spirits  by \nmeans  of  another  conjuration. \n\nGreenfield  notes  that  three  out  of  the  five  chief  démons,  namely  Babet, \nBaltasar  and  Beelzeboul,  can  be  also  found  in  the  short  list  of  the  planetary \ndémons  of  the  Treatise,  as  démons  of  Friday  and  Saturday.1 \n\nThe  name  of  the  vessel,  pibaktorion  (A,  B)  pibatarin  (H)  and  bartarin  (G)  is \nunknown  from  any  other  sources.  It  seems  that  the  word  was  originally \nepibaktron,  derived  from  baktron,  stick,  and  the  préposition  epi,  upon.  The \nepibaktron  then  may  be  a  water  pot,  hanging  on  the  end  of  a  yoke  or  beam. \n\nThe  use  of  the  unspoken  water  ( amilêto  nero),  the  spring  water  which  is \ncarried  without  the  bearer's  speaking,  is  a  common  tradition  in  Greece.  It  is \nusually  connected  with  the  klëdona,  the  divinatory  ceremony  that  takes  place \nat  St.  John's  day,  but  it  also  has  healing  properties.  It  seems  that  originally \npeople  would  not  speak,  in  order  not  to  disturb  the  fairy  of  the  spring  or \nwell.2  Interestingly,  a  similar  tradition  survives  in  Scotland.3 \n\n48.  Bottle  divination  (Lekanomanteia) \n\nThis  method  is  preserved  in  A,  B  and  partially  in  H  and  B2.  A  virgin \nchild  is  also  needed  for  this  operation.  The  magister  takes  'smudge'  from  the \nbottom  of  a  frying  pan,  mixes  it  with  olive  oil  and  makes  an  ink,  with  which \nhe  draws  certain  characters  on  the  child's  palm.  Then  the  incenses  are \nburned,  coriander  and  nigella,  and  a  conjuration  is  recited,  in  order  for  the \nspirits  to  appear.  Although  the  operation  is  named  lekanomanteia,  that  is  to \nsay  'basin  divination',  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  a  basin,  since  the  spirits \nappear  in  a  bottle.  This  operation  should  not  be  confused  either  with  the \ncopper  bowl  divination  that  is  also  improperly  named  lekanomanteia  or  with \nthe  unique  operations  that  appear  in  N  or  G. \n\n1  Greenfield,  Traditions  of  Belief,  p.  225. \n\n2  Politis,  Paradoseis,  pp.  395  for  St.  John’s  day;  pp.  295,  309  for  the  healing  properties  of  the \nunspoken  water,  and  p.  290  for  the  fairy  of  the  spring. \n\n3  Various,  The  Mirror  of  Literature,  p.  40.\n"

Then  he  must  fill  a  bowl  with  this  water  and  leave  it  outdoors  at \nnight.  At  dawn,  he  must  recite  certain  Psalms,  name  what  he  wants  to  see \nand  place  a  mirror  in  the  water.  This  way  he  is  expected  to  see  a  relevant \nvision. \n\n51.

A  child  with  blue  eyes  has  the  rôle  of  the \nmedium.  The  child  looks  at  the  vessel,  covered  with  a  red  cloth.  The  diviner \nthen  recites  certain  nomina  barbara  seven  times,  and  the  child  is  expected  to \nsee  spirits  in  human  shape.  The  spirits  are  asked  to  préparé  a  meal  for  their \nlord,  and  when  the  lord  finishes  his  meal  he  is  conjured  to  answer  the \ndiviner's  questions. \n\nThe  offering  of  visionary  feasts  to  the  spirits  is  a  motif  known  at  least \nfrom  late  antiquity.

The  Great  Blessing  of  Waters \nis  held  twice  a  year,  on  the  Feast  of  Epiphany  and  on  the  eve  of  the  same.  On \nthe  other  hand,  the  Lesser  Blessing  of  Waters  is  performed  according  to  need \nduring  the  rest  of  the  year.  It  seems  that  the  Lesser  Blessing  is  but  an  altered \nform  of  the  Great  one,  and  that  the  Great  Blessing,  in  its  tum,  is  an  altered \nform  of  the  Rite  of  Baptism.2  Although  among  theologians  prevails  the \nopinion  that  the  supremacy  of  the  Great  Blessing  is  solely  honorific  and \nsymbolical,  in  popular  belief  there  is  a  tendency  to  ascribe  a  greater \nsanctifying  power  to  it.  There  are  people  who  even  fast  before  drinking  the \nGreat  Holy  Water  and  maintain  that  it  can  even  replace  the  Holy \nCommunion  at  the  6*  of  January. \n\n52.  Divination  by  means  ofa  basin,  a  kettle  and  a  glass \n\nThis  method  exists  in  P,  B2  and  V.  A  circle  has  to  be  traced  on  the \nground.  The  diviner  must  place  a  copper  kettle  upside  down  in  a  basin,  and \nfinally  superimpose  a  glass  full  of  water  and  olive  oil.  P  omits  the  basin.  A \nvirgin  child  looks  at  the  glass,  while  the  diviner  recites  various  nomina \nbarbara.  The  child  must  see  four  or  five  spirits,  who  answer  any  question. \n\n53.  Copper  bowl  divination  (Lekanomanteia) \n\nThis  simple  method  exists  in  B2  and  V.  One  must  take  a  copper  bowl \nand  write  the  word  Tzetetrel  on  its  bottom.  Then  he  must  take  nettleroot  and \nwrite  the  same  word  upon  it.  The  bowl  is  to  be  filled  with  water  and  the  root \nplaced  in  the  water.  Then  pne  can  look  at  the  bowl  and  see  anything  he  wants \nto  know.  The  operation  is  also  improperly  called  lekanomanteia,  basin \ndivination. \n\n54.

          "text": "111 \n\nThe  Magical  Treatise  of  Solomon \n\nneeds  a  virgin  boy,  a  mirror  and  the  knife  of  the  art.  By  means  of  the  knife  he \ntraces  the  magical  circle  and  then  he  thrusts  it  in  the  centre.  The  boy  must \nhold  the  mirror  above  the  knife  and  repeat  the  conjuration  that  the  magister \nrecites.  The  spirit  to  be  summoned  at  the  end  is  the  fairy  queen  Sympilia,  but \nthe  magister  has  to  contact  her  gradually.  First  of  ail,  a  cook  in  the  form  of  a \nlame  horseman  is  ordered  to  appear.  Then,  the  cook  is  ordered  to  send  his \nservant  to  bring  three  lambs.  The  lambs  are  cooked,  the  table  is  prepared  and \nqueen  Sympilia  is  asked  to  attend  the  meal.  Afterwards,  the  queen  and  her \ncourt  take  a  vow  to  say  the  truth,  so  ail  is  ready  for  the  magister  to  ask \nanything  he  wants  to  know.  A  shorter  version  that  includes  a  feast,  this  time \naddressed  to  the  spirit  Mpeltzampël,  can  also  be  found  in  B2. \n\nThe  name  Sympilia  or  Sibylia  is  derived  from  Sibylla,  the  mythological \nGreek  prophetess.  There  seems  to  be  a  dissension  among  ancient  writers \nwhether  there  was  one  or  more  Sibylles,  their  number  at  times  reaching  ten, \nor  even  twelve  in  the  Middle  Ages.  One  of  them,  the  Libyan  Sibylla  was \nregarded  as  daughter  of  Zeus  and  Lamia,  thus  forming  a  bond  with  her  other \nname  in  Greek  folklore.  Greenfield  refers  to  'Dona  Zabella'  and  to  'Sabia \nSibila'  of  the  Sicilian  Fairy  Cuit,  who  is  sometimes  regarded  as  Solomon's \nsister.1 \n\nThe  lame  démon  is  also  a  common  mythical  character  in  Greece.  At \ntimes  he  is  believed  to  be  the  chief  of  the  goblin-like  créatures  kalikantzaroi, \nthe  son  of  the  fairy  queen  that  hides  things  from  their  owners,  or  even  the \ndevil  himself,  his  leg  being  devoured  by  the  wolf  he  created.  In  every  case,  he \nis  considered  extremely  fast,  despi  te  his  lameness.2 \n\n55.  Crystal  stone  divination  (Krystallomanteia) \n\nThis  simple  method  can  be  found  in  P,  B2,  V  and  M2.  A  child  must  stare \nat  a  crystal  stone,  opposite  the  Sun.  The  diviner  recites  a  short  prayer  and  the \nimage  of  a  thief  is  expected  to  appear  in  the  stone. \n\n56.  Divination  by  means  ofan  egg  (Oomanteia) \n\nThis  method  appears  only  in  B2  and  V.  An  egg  from  a  black  hen  is  put  in \nolive  oil  for  several  hours,  in  order  to  serve  as  a  mirror  for  this  simple \ndivination. \n\n1  Greenfield,  Traditions  of  Belief  p.  1 89. \n\n2  Politis ,Paradoseis,  pp.  251,  260, 290,  389  and  381-382.\n"

If  its  juice  is \nused  as  an  enema  with  honey  and  washing  soda,  it  cures  hemorrhoids.  If  it  is \ndnmk  with  honey,  it  thins  down  the  liquids  of  the  organism.  This  herb  is  also \nuseful  for  sexual  intercourse,  since  the  juice  is  given  to  people  who  are \ncopulating.  If  the  root  is  placed  in  a  house,  it  banishes  every  evil  démon. \n\nThe  herb  of  Mercury  is  the  cinquefoil,  but  others  call  it  pentaphyllon.

It  helps  against  the  disease  of  the  stone  and  the  difficult  micturition. \n\nThe  herb  of  Mars  is  the  common  plantain.

It  is  suitable  [f.  388v]  against  dysentery,  hemorrhoids, \ninflammations  and  poisons. \n\nThe  herb  of  Jupiter  is  the  sugarcane.  If  its  root  is  drunk  with  honey,  it  cures \nswollen  glands,  the  goût  in  the  feet  and  liver  complaints.  If  it  is  worn  it  is \nuseful  for  sexual  intercourse  and  it  makes  women  eager  to  copulation. \n\nThe  herb  of  Satum  is  the  daffodil  or  herakleia.  If  its  juice  is  drunk  with  styrax, \nit  cures  the  pains  of  the  knees  and  the  feet.  If  the  juice  of  the  root  is  boiled,  it \nbenefits  the  pains  of  the  kidneys  and  it  drives  away  the  fears  of  the \npossessed.  If  it  is  worn  as  an  amulet,  it  is  suitable  for  children  who  eut  teeth. \n\nThe  herb  of  the  Moon  is  the  caper.

This  is  the  reason  why  seven  planets  and  seven  spheres  are \ncreated  among  the  stars.  Each  day  is  ruled  by  a  planet.  The  days  are  seven,  so \nthe  seven  stars  rule  them. \n\nSeventh  day :  Saturday  is  attributed  to  the  highest  planet,  Satum,  whose  sign  is \nthis  [sign  of  Satum],  Satum  rules  the  first  hour  of  the  first  day,1  which  is \nusef ul  for  harming  a  person  and  acting  against  one's  enemies.  It  is  also  useful \nfor  the  questioning  of  spirits  in  a  glass  vessel  full  of  water,  for  actions  related \nto  treasures  and  for  educating  children.  The  other  planets  rule  the  next  hours \nin  their  order,  until  the  seventh.  Then,  Saturn  rules  again  and  the  other \nplanets  follow.  Saturday  is  attributed  to  Saturn  only,  the  other  planets  ruling \nthe  hours. \n\nFifth  day :  Thursday  is  attributed  to  Jupiter,  whose  sign  is  this  [sign  of  Jupiter]. \nAnd  Jupiter  rules  the  first  hour  of  this  day,  which  is  [f.  19]  useful  for  actions \nrelated  to  bravery,  for  being  glorified  by  people,  for  the  destruction  of \nsorceries,  for  success  in  hunting  and  for  healing  people;  it  almost  gives \nsuccess  to  everything. \n\nThird  day:  Tuesday  is  attributed  to  Mars,  whose  sign  is  this  [sign  of  Mars]. \nMars  rules  the  first  hour  of  this  day,  as  the  other  planets  do.  During  this  hour \none  may  make  a  parchment  talisman  and  carry  it  at  war.  This  way  they  will \nnot  be  in  danger  during  the  war.  This  hour  is  also  good  for  fighting  with \nknives,  for  fighting  against  enemies,  for  courage  and  for  battle.  And  it  is \nbénéficiai  for  blood-letting.  It  is  the  hour  of  Mars,  so  it  is  very  good  for  blood- \nletting. \n\nFirst  day:  The  first  day  is  the  day  of  the  Sun  [sign  of  the  Sun]  who  is  also \nnamed  \"the  first  luminary\".  The  Sun  rules  the  first  hour,  which  is  useful  for \nmaking  a  parchment  talisman  in  order  to  ask  a  favor  from  the  authorities,  to \nfind  a  treasure  and  to  cause  everything  to  be  revealed. \n\nSecond  day:  Monday  is  attributed  to  the  Moon  [sign  of  the  Moon],  as  it  is  the \nsecondary  luminary  in  the  world.  The  Moon  also  rules  the  first  hour.  During \nthis  hour  you  may  act  in  order  to  dominate  people.  It  is  also  good  for  selling \nand  buying,  for  asking  an  office,  for  lending  and  borrowing  money,  and  the \nsimilar. \n\nFourth  day:  Wednesday  is  the  day  of  Mercury.  Mercury  also  mies  the  first \nhour,  which  it  is  bénéficiai  for  travelling  and  hunting.  This  hour  is  also  good \nfor  gaining  wisdom,  for  metalworking,  for  actions  aiming  to  one's  contact \n\n'This  is  evidently  a  mistake  of  the  copyist.  Originally  it  would  be  “of  this  day.”\n"

They  also  become  bénéficiai  when  they  dwell  in  the  houses \nof  the  bénéficiai  signs,  but  they  become  corrupted  when  they  are  in  the \nmalign  signs.  For  this  reason  they  are  called  malign. \n\nWhen  you  want,  my  beloved  son  Rehoboam,  to  do  something  correctly  and \neffectively,  at  first  you  must  leam  the  prayers  of  the  seven  planets  and  pray \nto  the  planet  you  want  to  work  with.  Recite  the  prayer  of  the  planet  that  is \nrelated  and  bénéficiai  to  your  action.  Then,  ask  the  angel  who  rules  the \nplanet  to  subdue  the  démon  who  serves  at  the  first  hour,  cense  the  incenses \nof  the  planet,  kneel  opposite  the  Sun  and  pray.  Glorify  God,  say  what  you  are \ngoing  to  do,  and  pray  on  your  knees.  Here  follow  the  prayers. \n\nThe  prayer  of  Satum,  on  Saturday \n\nLord  our  God,  the  great  and  suprême,  who  created  and  fashioned  man, \nthe  abyss  saw  you  and  feared,  the  living  saw  you  and  became  lifeless.  In \nHis  name  and  by  His  great  and  mighty  [f.  20]  power  I  conjure  you, \nSaturn.  By  the  height  of  the  heaven  and  by  the  depth  of  the  sea,  I  conjure \nyou,  Satum,  do  not  disobey  me.  By  your  antiquity  and  by  your  pré¬ \néminence  I  conjure  you,  O  cold  Satum,  who  has  authority  over  every \nharm,  who  gives  treasures  and  who  offers  everything.  I  conjure  you \nagain,  O  Saturn,  in  your  following  names,  Arphin,  Orkip,  Ouliob,  Berik, \nOuraphon,  Sarôk,  Taimon,  Odel,  Sigëp,  Sotad,  grant  your  grâce  and  your \nvirtue  to  every  work  I  want  to  accomplish.\n"

One  must  abstain  from  sin  for  a  long \ntime  and  be  cleansed  before  the  operation.  Because  the  person  who  purified \nhimself,  fasted,  confessed  ail  the  sins  he  has  committed  so  that  he  did  not \nhide  anything,  abstained  from  sin  and  knows  what  we  hâve  said  before,  will \nmanage  to  do  the  operation.

That  is  to  say,  draw  the  four  circles  on  the  side  near \neach  other.

Make  the  upper  circle  [f.  28v]  at  a  distance  from  the  first  four  circles, \nbut  near  to  the  other  four.  Make  the  final  circle,  the  tenth,  near  the  other  four \ncircles,  but  at  a  distance  from  the  first  four.  You  must  encompass  ail  the  circles  in  a \nfigure;  draw  the  lines  with  black  ink,  but  make  the  inner  part  red.  Moreover,  you \nhâve  to  make  the  ladngs,  which  must  be  twenty  two.  Use  black  ink  to  draw  the \nlines  that  encompass  and  are  encompassed  in  the  central  part  of  the  lamen. \nHowever,  ail  letters  and  signs  must  be  red,  written  with  the  aforementioned  ink \nBe  very  careful  to  make  the  seal  as  you  see  it,  and  not  to  fall  out  of  line  at  ail.  As  it \nis  said,  in  this  lies  the  entire  power  of  summoning  the  spirits,  the  safety  and  the \nguard  of  the  conjurer.  You  hâve  to  wear  it  on  your  chest  when  you  are  going  to \nenter  the  circle.  Enough  hâve  been  said  about  the  lamen.2 \n\n’The  word  pantokrator  means  “almighty.” \n\n2Âfter  folio  28v,  that  concludes  with  the  incomplète  figure  of  the  lamen,  the  text  continues  to \nfolio  33.

You  must  uproot  it  at  the  hour  that  the  Sun  rules,  reciting  the \nprayer  to  the  angel.  This  herb  turns  its  upper  part  towards  the  Sun.  It  is \ncalled  opousasôlës2  by  the  Francs. \n\nIt  has  this  virtue:  Take  the  whole  herb,  go  to  a  place  where  a  treasure  is \nhidden,  stand  upon  it  and  do  not  move.  Wrap  it  in  a  white  piece  of  cloth  with \nfrankincense,  hold  it  in  your  right  hand  and  stand  where  the  money  is.  The \nplace  will  open  and  you  will  see  what  is  hidden.

Fast  and  keep  yourself  pure  during  this \nday,  which  must  be  the  day  of  Mercury.  Pour  the  water  in  a  clean  bowl  of \ngolden  color  and  leave  it  outdoors  for  one  night,  under  the  stars  and  the \ncloudless  sky.  Write  the  question  that  you  want  to  ask  around  the  bowl,  with \nyour  ring  finger.  At  dawn  go  back  to  the  water  and  take  a  clean  mirror  with \nyou.  Invoke  the  name  of  God,  place  the  mirror  in  the  water  to  a  depth  of  one \nfinger  and  say  again  what  you  traced  with  your  ring  finger.  Then,  recite  the \n57 th  and  the  77th  Psalms.  After  this,  look  at  the  mirror  within  the  water,  and \nyou  will  see  a  vision  about  your  question. \n\n'This  is  version  II  of  the  water  divination.\n"

The  Head  of  the  Dragon  rules  when  Satum  rules,  on  Saturday,  from \nthe  first  hour  of  Saturday  night,  until  the  twenty  four  hours  of  night  and  day \nare  completed.  But  the  Tail  rules  after  the  hour  of  Satum  on  Sunday,  that  is \nto  say,  from  the  first  hour  of  Sunday  night,  until  the  twenty  four  hours  of \nnight  and  day  are  completed,  like  the  Head.  And  you  may  also  know  the \nfollowing:  When  the  Head  of  the  Dragon  rules,  be  careful  not  to  travel,  because \nit  signifies  much  trouble  and  dangers.  And  again,  when  the  Tail  of  the  Dragon \nrules  and  you  are  travelling  by  land,  it  signifies  bloodshed  and  murders. \n\nConceming  the  Dragon  who  résides  in  the  ninth  heaven \n\nThere  is  a  ninth  heaven  that  is  called  starless,  because  it  does  not  hâve  stars. \nBut  there  is  a  sole  star  in  it,  in  the  likeness  of  a  snake.  It  surrounds  this \nheaven  completely.  Four  actions  take  place  within  this  star.  Sometimes  it \nopens  its  mouth  and  yawns,  sometimes  it  moves  and  clicks  its  tongue, \nsometimes  it  shakes  [f,  5]  its  tail,  and  sometimes  it  quivers  its  middle  parts. \nBehold,  the  four  actions  bring  four  effects.  When  it  yawns,  it  shows  death. \nBecause  when  it  yawns,  it  shows  that  the  earth  will  receive  human  bodies. \nWhen  it  clicks  its  tongue,  it  foretells  war,  because  its  tongue  is  sword-like. \nWhen  it  shakes  its  tail,  hunger  will  take  place  on  the  whole  earth.  And  when \nit  quivers  its  middle  parts,  it  reveals  great  earthquakes. \n\nThis  is  the  explanation:  Behold  four  signs  of  the  Zodiac  that  are  in  conformity \nwith  the  snake:  Cancer,  Léo,  Scorpio  and  Capricom.  Watch  and  observe  the \nday  of  March  when  the  Sun  enters  Aries.  Find  the  position  of  the  Moon  at \nthis  day.  If  the  Moon  is  in  one  of  the  aforementioned  signs  on  the  13*  of \nMarch,2  you  may  know  that  the  snake  gave  one  of  his  signs  for  this  year.  If \nthe  Moon  is  in  Cancer  on  the  13th  of  March,  you  may  know  that  the  snake \nyawned  and  it  shows  death.  If  the  Moon  is  in  Léo,  the  snake  clicked  its \ntongue  and  this  means  war  in  the  whole  world.  If  the  Moon  is  in  Scorpio  on \nthe  13*  of  March,  you  may  know  that  the  snake  quivered  its  middle  parts \nand  this  foretells  great  earthquakes  in  the  world.  And  if  the  Moon  is  in \n\n1  The  Head  and  Tail  of  the  Dragon  are  in  fact  the  points  where  the  orbit  of  the  Moon \nintersects  the  Ecliptic.  However  the  author  of  this  section  believes  that  it  is  a  celestial  body \nplaced  above  the  eighth  heaven  of  the  fîxed  stars,  according  to  the  geocentric  System,  and  that \nits  orbit  is  somehow  connected  with  Satum. \n\n2  Note  that  this  section  was  written  in  the  13th  or  14*  century,  when  the  Spring  Equinox  fell \non  the  13*  of  March,  according  to  the  Julian  calendar.\n"

If  you  draw  a  circle  within  a  circle,  the  inner  circle  happens \nto  be  smaller.  This  way,  the  orbit  of  the  Moon,  which  is  lower,  is  smaller  and \ncan  be  traversed  more  quickly. \n\nConcerning  the  Zodiac:  The  Zodiac  moves  aslant  and  it  is  divided  into \ntwelve  parts,  which  are  called  signs. \n\nComment :  Observe  and  learn  if  the  days  of  the  Moon  and  the  days  of  the  Sun \nhappen  to  be  [f.  lOv]  in  harmony.  See  the  bénéficiai  days  of  the  Moon,  as  well \nas  the  bénéficiai  signs  and  planets,  in  the  tables  below. \n\nConcerning  the  orbit  of  the  Moon  and  the  day  of  the  Moon \n\nIf  you  want  to  find  the  day  of  the  Moon,  as  it  is  traversing  from  sign  to  sign, \ncount  the  days  from  January  till  the  présent  month;  add  the  date  of  the \nprésent  month;  add  the  Fundament  of  the  Moon  for  this  year,  whatever  it  is, \nand  do  the  sum.  Subtract  ail  thirties  from  the  sum,  and  you  will  hâve  the  day \nof  the  Moon,  as  it  is  shown  in  the  above  table.1 \n\nConcerning  the  signs  that  rule  water \n\nYou  may  know  that  four  signs  rule  water:  Gemini,  Cancer,  Aquarius  and \nPisces.  [f.  11]  When  they  receive  the  Moon,  they  cause  rain  to  fall  on  the \nearth.  But  Gemini  is  more  watery  than  the  others  and  the  time  of  its  reign \ncarries  much  water. \n\nConcerning  the  dragon \n\nIf  someone  wants  to  know  which  of  the  twelve  signs  reigns  during  a  year, \nwhat  it  signifies,  what  power  it  has  and  to  what  effect:  If  the  Moon  is  in \nCancer  at  the  13th  of  March,  you  may  know  that  the  dragon  yawned  and  it \nshows  death  in  the  world.  If  the  Moon  is  in  Léo,  you  may  know  that  the \ndragon  throbbed  its  tongue  and  this  means  war.  If  the  Moon  is  in  Scorpio, \nyou  may  know  that  the  snake  shook  its  tail,  and  it  indicates  hunger  in  the \nworld.  And  if  the  Moon  is  in  Capricorn,  you  may  know  that  the  dragon \nquivered  its  middle  parts,  and  this  signifies  great  earthquakes.  [f.  llv] \n\n1  It  seems  that  there  was  a  table  for  the  bénéficiai  days  of  the  Moon  in  the  original,  as  in  A, \nbut  it  was  not  copied  in  this  manuscript.\n"

[f.  9 7v] \n\nConceming  the  herbs  attributed  to  the  hours  ofthe  seven  planets  and  their  virtues \nThe  herb  ofSatum  [image  of  the  daffodil],  the  daffodil \n\nThis  is  named  daffodil,  the  herb  of  Satum  -  the  peony  is  also  a  Satumian \nherb  of  great  [f.  98]  virtue.  Satum  rules  mainly  at  Saturday,  at  the  first  hour. \nFirst  recite  the  prayer  of  Satum  and  then  uproot  it,  as  the  instruction  about \nthe  peony  says. \n\nTake  one  grain  from  the  top  of  its  root  and  carry  it  with  you;  you  will  never \nbe  subject  to  injustice  by  a  foui  judge. \n\nWrap  one  grain  from  the  top  of  the  herb  in  a  he-goat's  skin,  wear  it  on  your \narm  or  on  your  neck,  and  you  will  not  be  afraid  of  robbers  on  your  way, \nbecause  they  will  worship  you  as  a  god. \n\nTake  a  grain  from  the  top  or  from  the  root  of  the  herb  and  wrap  it  in  white \nsilk  together  with  small  portions  of  house  leek,  mandrake  and  peony.  Write \nthese  signs  [signs]2  on  an  unborn  parchment.  Hang  ail  these  on  the  neck  of  a \nwhite  rooster.  Let  him  go  free  and  follow  him.  It  is  miraculous:  If  there  is  a \ntreasure  hidden  nearby,  he  will  go  and  hoe  upon  the  place  it  is  hidden.  And \nif  he  goes  too  far,  he  will  reveal  the  place  by  his  crow.  Mark  the  place. \n\nAnother  one:  [f.  98 v]  Take  seven  grains  of  the  herb  and  one  grain  of  pure \nmusk,  mix  them,  give  them  to  a  sick  person  to  drink,  and  he  will  be  cured. \nGive  them  to  the  epileptic  to  drink  seven  times,  and  they  will  be  cured. \n\nIf  you  want  to  destroy  your  enemies,  put  a  grain  of  the  herb  on  the  dried \nskull  of  a  dog  and  place  it  in  your  house. \n\nIf  you  want  to  know  someone's  secrets,  take  some  of  the  herb's  root,  place  it \nat  his  head  when  he  sleeps,  ask  him,  and  you  will  leam  them. \n\nAnother  one:  Wash  some  daffodil  bulbs,  smash  them  and  boil  them  with \nvinegar  in  a  pan.  Apply  them  to  carbuncles.  It  cures  and  extinguishes  the \ncarbuncles  that  reappear.  Boil  them  fresh  as  instructed  &lt;and  apply  them&gt;  to \nwhatever  evil  the  skin  produces. \n\nFor  headache:  Take  some  of  the  leaves,  grind  them,  mix  them  with  rose  water \n\n1  Sangin  does  not  cite  this  paragraph,  except  from  its  beginning  and  end.  He  only  notes  that  it  is \nsimilar  to  the  relevant  paragraph  of  M.

He  must  eat  and  swallow  them.  Moreover,  let  the  epileptic  drink \nthe  root  together  with  strong  white  wine,  beginning  from  the  New  Moon  and \nuntil  the  thirtieth  day.  If  drunk,  the  root  can  cure  epilepsy  in  seven  days. \n\nFor  the  spleen:  At  the  waxing  of  the  Moon,  the  root  cures  the  swollen  spleen, \nas  well  as  the  fever,  the  shiver  and  the  tertian  fever,  if  it  is  drunk  with  wine \nfor  four  days,  beginning  from  the  New  Moon. \n\nIts  fruit  cures  diarrhea  and  dysentery,  if  it  is  drunk  with  honey  for  ten  days, \nat  the  waxing  of  the  Moon. \n\nMoreover,  its  fruit  cures  the  pus  and  every  pain,  if  it  is  drunk  with  theriaca 1 \n\n1  Theriaca,  thêriakê,  was  a  medical  concoction,  invented  by  Nero’s  physician,  Andromakhos.\n"

Let  the  place  be  at  the  peak  of  a \nmountain,  in  the  woods,  in  an  ancient  cave,  near  the  sea,  at  a  place  where \nneither  the  crowing  of  a  rooster  nor  the  voices  of  men  can  be  heard,  at  a  pure \nand  trackless  place,  near  a  river,  or  near  a  meeting  of  three  roads.  It  has  to  be \nfar  f rom  people,  where  nobody  can  hear  or  see,  in  order  not  to  be  obstructed \nby  anybody. \n\nWhen  the  Sun  goes  opposite  the  Moon,  put  on  the  aforementioned  ring,  take \nthe  knife  of  the  art  and  trace  the  circle  on  the  ground.  The  ground  must  be \nf lattened  and  well  swept,  in  order  to  receive  the  signs  of  the  circle  that  will  be \ntraced  with  the  knife.  You  must  hâve  two  braziers,  new  and  clean.  Fill  them \nwith  lit  charcoals  that  are  not  smoking,  and  place  upon  them  the  following \nincenses:  [f.  20v]  aloe  wood,  fragrant  costus,  cloves,  nutmeg,  saffron  and \nfragrant  frankincense.  Moreover,  add  some  water  lily,  nigella,  root  of \ndaf fodil  and  blood  of  a  man  that  was  killed  undeservedly. \n\nAfter  the  censing,  take  the  knife  of  the  art  at  once  and  trace  the  circle  inside \nand  the  square  outside.  Allow  enough  width  and  length  to  contain  two \npersons.  Make  the  gâte  just  enough  for  somebody  to  go  in  and  out.  Let  the \ngâte  be  towards  the  south  and  be  careful  not  to  step  upon  the  letters  of  the \ngâte  when  you  go  in  and  out. \n\nLet  the  Moon  be  at  its  fourteenth  day.  If  this  happens  at  night,  you  must  hâve \na  lantern  and  tapers,  so  that  you  can  read  the  conjurations  without  the \ncandies  being  extinguished  by  the  spirits.  But  if  you  do  this  at  daytime,  you \nneed  no  lanterns,  nor  tapers.  The  circle  is  the  one  depicted  below.  Think  well, \nin  order  not  to  fail  in  your  aim. \n\n[f.  21]  Concerning  the  ring  ofthe  art \n\nTake  pure  and  virgin  wax  and  make  a  ring  to  wear  on  your  right  &lt;index&gt; \nfinger,  after  you  coat  it  with  virgin  parchment.  Write  the  following  twelve \nnames  upon  the  parchment  with  the  pen  and  the  ink  of  the  art.

All rights reserved. \nLast updated Sep 30, 2025.\n\nNOTE: A new, reformatted edition of Mathers' edition, with new artwork is now available. \n\nINTRODUCTION by Joseph H. Peterson.\n\nThe Key of Solomon is the most famous and important of\nall Grimoires, or handbooks of Magic.  As A.E. Waite has stated (BCM, pg. 58)\n\"At the head of all, and, within certain limits, the inspiration and\nthe source of all, stands the Key of Solomon.  ... Mr. Mathers' presentation\nof the Key of Solomon, which is still in print, though the work of an uncritical\nhand, must be held to remove the necessity for entering into a detailed account of the\ncontents of that curious work. ... The Key of Solomon can scarcely\nbe judged accurately in the light of its English version, for the translator,\npreternaturally regarding it as a highly honourable memorial of lawful magic, has\nexcised as much as possible the Goëtic portions, on the ground that they\nare interpolations, which is of course arbitrary.\"\n\nMr. Waite's harsh criticism is hardly justified. In fact, Mathers excised\nvery little. Actually, three of the four significant excisions are operations dealing with\nlove magic (Colorno, chapters 11-13: The experiment of Love, and how it should be performed;\nThe experiment or operation of the fruit; Of the operation of love by her dreams, and how\none must practice it.  The fourth excision is chapter 14: Operations and experiments regarding\nhate and destruction of enemies.)\n\nIt is true that the Mathers edition would not be considered critical by modern standards\nof scholarship (but Waite's editions of various esoteric texts leave far more to be\ndesired than Mathers').  Especially wanting are a proper critical apparatus,\nan analysis of the relation between manuscripts, and better utilization of the Latin\nand Italian manuscripts. Nevertheless, this edition has stood the test of time.\n"

          "text": "MANUSCRIPTS\n\nOf course, none of the manuscripts used by Mathers qualify as \"ancient\";.\nThe earliest reference is 1303-10 in Peter of Abano's Lucidator dubitabilium astronomiae. \nThe oldest ms. known at this point is a partial manuscript (2 leaves, \nmanuscrit 86� de la Biblioth�que capitulaire de Trente) that dates to 1380-1410, \nrecently discovered by Matteo Cova.\n(Cova, Matteo. �Un manuale di negromanzia a Trento:\nrinvenimento e studio dei pi� antichi frammenti della\nClavicula Salomonis�. Studi Trentini - Storia 100, fasc. 1, (2021): 149�76.\ncited in Gal Sofer's PhD thesis, Solomonic Magic: Texts, History, and Reception, 2022, p. 77 n 93.)\n\nThere is also a manuscript in Italian, BNF Ital. 1524, dated 1446.\nIt was probably translated from a \"copy of the Latin text that was in the library of the Duke Filippo Maria in Pavia in 1426.\"\n(Jean-Patrice Boudet, \"Magic at Court\" in Sophie Page, Catherine Rider, et al., The Routledge History of Medieval Magic,\nLondon: Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group, p. 339.)\nThe oldest Latin manuscript (Coxe 25) dates to late 15th century.\nThere is an earlier table of contents though (1260? See J.P. Boudet, Entre Science, appendix).\n\nThere are however precedents going back further, on which see Richard Greenfield's\nTraditions of Belief in Late Byzantine Demonology.\n\nMathers' translation\nis almost entirely based on French Colorno manuscript exemplars dating 18th century.\nThese are represented by the Kings 288, Harley 3981, and Sloane 3091 manuscripts. \nKings 288 and Harl. 3981 indicate they were translated by Abraham Colorno, which \nphrase is missing from Sl. 3091.\nOf these Sl. 3091 and Kings 288 are easier to read. \nAbraham Colorno, \na Jewish engineer of Mantua (fl. 1578-1598), translated it into Italian.\nKings 288 includes some phrases which are missing from Harley 3981, so the former is \nprobably not a direct ancestor of the latter. \nSl. 3091 likewise has some phrases missing from the others, and \nregularly replaces \"Amen\" with \"Ainsi soit-il\" (so be it).\nAlthough Mathers felt Sl3091 \"has many errors of transcription,\" I have generally found it to \nbe the most correct of the Colorno group (i.e. between Sl3091, H3981, K288, and L1202.)\n\nIn addition, Mathers made significant use of Lansdowne 1202, even though he pronounces it\n\"more concise in style.\" Its title page reads: \"LES VRAIS CLAVICULES DU ROI\nSALOMON PAR ARMADEL.\" The wording in L1202 often coincides exactly with the\nColorno manuscripts, which convinces me that it was based mainly on a Colorno ancestor.\nHowever the frequent deviations and elisions suggest to me that the editor was trying to\nmake a more concise and readable edition, which of course makes its authority less reliable.\nL1202 displays simple mistakes in some of the Latin passages. \nIt also regularly replaces \"Amen\" with \"Ainsi soit-il\".\nWhere K288 differs from H3981, L1202 generally seems to follow the latter.\nWhere Sl3091 differs from the others, L1202 generally follows it.\nHowever, L1202 can't be a direct ancestor of Sl3091 since it contains elements missing from \nthe latter, such as the missing Psalm and \"Anefeneton\" from book 2 chapter 17.\nNonetheless, it is safe to say that L1202 is derived from a closely related manuscript.\n\nAlso heavily used by Mathers was LES VÉRITABLES CLAVICULES\nDE SALOMON, Traduites de l'Hebreux en langue Latine Par le Rabin ABOGNAZAR\n(Lansdowne MSS 1203.)  Its inclusion by Mathers is puzzling because it is utterly\ndifferent in content from the other manuscripts (aside from a few of the pentacles\nat the end of the manuscript) and really should stand alone as a separate text.\nAnother copy can be found in ms. fran�. 25314 de la Bibliothèque nationale.\n\nAdditional 10862 is primarily written in Latin, although \nthe descriptions of the pentacles are in Italian. It was written ca. 17th century.\nMathers considered it his oldest and sole Latin source, but makes only \nlimited use of it.\nContrary to what Mathers wrote, I did not find it particularly difficult to read \nonce I got use to the orthography; likewise it has very few abbreviations: \nBesides using \"&\" for \"per\" (particle and prefix) it frequently \nuses abbreviations for \"-tur\" and \"-bus\" which are sometimes indistinguishable.\nIt doesn't distinguish between u and v, \nand uniformly uses an archaic form of the ae-ligature (e-caudata).\nIt is somewhat more succinct than the Colorno manuscripts, so may preserve \nsome earlier stage in the evolution of the text. There are also frequent \nvariations from the other manuscripts, many of which are clearly errors. \nThe nature of the mistakes leads me to believe that its archetype was \ndifficult to read. The pentacles are labelled with the appropriate \ncolors. The Latin sometimes corresponds closely with that in Aub. 24, \nhowever some of the text differs considerably.\n\nArticle 2 of Ad. 10862 is an Italian manuscript titled Zecorbenei, overo Clavicola dal re Salomone. \nThis is no doubt a version of the Zekerboni \n(or Secorbeni; also compare \"Zecorbeni\" in Aub. 24) \nand ascribed to Peter Mora (aka Pietro Mora or Pierre Mora).\nIn Ritual Magic (1949, pp. 135 f., p. 310) E. M. Butler describes Mora as an \"alchemist, \nblack magician, said to be a Satanist and poisoner who lived in Milan early in the \nseventeenth century, and burnt there after having confessed (under torture) to those crimes...\"\nCasanova seems to have possessed a version of the same work under the name Zecor-ben or \nZecorben. \n(Butler, loc. cit., Casanova, History of My Life, \ntranslated by Willard Trask, Volumes III & IV, 1967, p. 200).\n\nSloane 1307 \nis in Italian, and is also ca. 17th century. Prayers and conjurations \nare in Latin. It has much material not found in other manuscripts.\nSome of the material however can be found in Ad. 10862 art. 2 (\"Zecorbeni\") mentioned above. \nIt is hard to read, except for the mystical names which are carefully done. \nIt shares a lot of readings with Sl. 2383 (see below).\nSl. 1307 only has thirteen pentacles, and \nmuch of the lettering in them is in Roman letters instead of the Hebrew found in most other\nmanuscripts. \n\nFor more details on the individual manuscripts, see the\nBritish Library Manuscript catalogue.\nAlso, see MAGIC AND EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE by Lynn Thorndike,\n"

Mathers seems to have narrowed those in his \nedition to exclude most of these clearly later ones. \nTo give some sense of the state of these pentacles I have included many examples \nin my editions of L1202 and L1203.\n"

Some of the proliferation of weapons is \nno doubt due to errors in transcription and translation. For example, where the Latin manuscripts \nmention a quill knife (artavus), the Italian translator glosses this as a small pruning hook \n(l�artavo o falcetto), which Mathers mistranslates as \"scimitar AND sickle.\" \nIt is clear from the drawings that only one implement is being referred to. \n\nConspicuously absent is the Ring of Solomon, which figures prominently in folklore, as well as \nthe Testament of Solomon, the Magical Treatise of Solomon, and the \nLemegeton or Lesser Key of Solomon.  Although it is mentioned in \none of the conjurations, its construction and use is not otherwise mentioned.\n\nAnother curiosity involves the magical wand.\nAlthough prominent in most Clavicula manuscripts -- not to mention folk literature \nand the Greek Magical Papyri -- \nit is conspicuously absent from the Greek, Hebrew, \nand English manuscripts.\n\n-JHP\n\nThe Key of\n\nSolomon the King\n"

          "text": "NOTES:\n   \n\nThe Key of Solomon, save for a curtailed and incomplete copy published\nin France in the seventeenth century, has never yet been printed,\nbut has for centuries remained in manuscript form inaccessible \nto all but the few fortunate scholars to whom the inmost recesses \nof the great libraries were open. I therefore consider that I \nam highly honored in being the individual to whose lot it has \nfallen to usher it into the light of day.\n\nThe fountain-head and storehouse of Qabalistical magic, and the \norigin of much of the ceremonial magic of mediæval times, \nthe 'Key' has been ever valued by occult writers as a work of \nthe highest authority; and notably in our own day Eliphaz Lévi\nhas taken it for the model on which his celebrated 'Dogme et\nRituel de la Haute Magie' was based. It must be evident to\nthe initiated reader of Lévi, that the Key of Solomon was \nhis text book of study, and at the end of this volume I give a \nfragment of an ancient Hebrew manuscript of the Key of Solomon,\ntranslated and published in the Philosophie Occulte, as well \nas an invocation called the 'Qabalistical Invocation of Solomon,' \nwhich bears close analogy to one in the First Book, being constructed\nin the same manner on the scheme of the Sephiroth.\n\nThe history of the Hebrew original of the Key of Solomon, is \ngiven in the introductions, but there is every reason to suppose \nthat this has been entirely lost, and Christian, the pupil of \nLévi, says as much in his Histoire de la Magie.\n\nI see no reason to doubt the tradition which assigns the authorship\nof the 'Key' to King Solomon, for among others Josephus, the Jewish\nhistorian, especially mentions the magical works attributed to\nthat monarch; this is confirmed by many Eastern traditions, and\nhis magical skill is frequently mentioned in the Arabian Nights.\n\nThere are, however, two works on black magic, the Grimorium Verum, \nand the Clavicola di Salomone ridolta, which \nhave been attributed to Solomon, and which have been in some cases\nespecially mixed up with the present work; but which have nothing\nreally to do therewith; they are full of evil magic, and I cannot\ncaution the practical student too strongly against them.\n\nThere is also another work called Lemegeton or the Lesser Key\nof Solomon the King, which is full of seals of various spirits, \nand is not the same as the present book, though extremely valuable\nin its own department.\n\nIn editing this volume I have omitted one or two experiments partaking\nlargely of black magic, and which had evidently been derived from\nthe two goetic works mentioned above; I must further caution the\npractical worker against the use of blood; the prayer, the pentacle,\nand the perfumes, rightly used, are sufficient; and the former\nverges dangerously on the evil path. Let him who, in spite of\nthe warnings of this volume, determines to work evil, be assured\nthat evil will recoil on himself and that he will be struck by\nthe reflex current.\n\nThis work is edited from several ancient MSS. in the British Museum\nwhich all differ from each other in various points, some giving\nwhat is omitted by the others, but all unfortunately agreeing\nin one thing, which is the execrable mangling of the Hebrew words\nthrough the ignorance of the transcribers. But it is in the pentacles\nthat the Hebrew is worse, the letters being so vilely scribbled\nas to he actually undecipherable in some instances, and it has\nbeen part of my work for several years to correct and reinstate\nthe proper Hebrew and magical characters in the pentacles. The\nstudent may therefore safely rely on their being now as nearly\ncorrect in their present reproduction as it is possible for them\nto be. I have therefore, wherever I could, corrected the Hebrew\nof the magical names in the conjurations and pentacles; and in\nthe few instances where it was not possible to do so, I have put\nthem in the most usual form; carefully collating throughout one\nMS. with another. The chapters are a little differently classed\nin the various MSS., in some instances the matter contained in\nthem being transposed, &c. I have added notes wherever necessary.\n\nThe MSS. from which this work is edited are: -- Add. MSS., 10,862;\nSloane MSS., 1307 and 3091; Harleian MSS., 3981; King's MSS.,\n288; and Lansdowne MSS., 1202 and 1203; seven codices in all.\n\nOf all these 10,862 Add. MSS. is the oldest, its date being about\nthe end of the sixteenth century1; 3981 Harleian is probably about\nthe middle of the seventeenth century2; the others of rather later\ndate.\n\n  \n\n  1. The British Library catalogue \n  entry lists this as 17th century. -JHP\n  \n\n  2. Harley 3981 is probably eighteenth century. -JHP\n\n  \n\nAdd. MSS. 10,862 is written in contracted Latin, and is hard to\nread, but it contains chapters which are omitted in the others\nand also an important introduction. It is more concise in its\nwording. Its title is short, being simply 'The Key of Solomon,\ntranslated from the Hebrew language into the Latin.' An exact\ncopy of the signature of the writer of this MS. is given in figure 93.3 \nThe pentacles are very badly drawn.\n\n  \n\n  3. Manuscript title reads \"SALOMONIS Clavicula, ex idiomate Hebræo in Latinum traducta\".\n    The signature appears to read 'Ibau Abraham.' It was written ca. 17th century.\n  It is bound with an second copy in Italian titled \"Zecorbenei, overo Clavicola dal Re Salomone.\"\n  -JHP.\n  \n\nFigure 93, from Ad. 10862, fol. 80v.\n\n3981 Harleian MSS.; 288 King's MSS.; and 3091 Sloane MSS., are\nsimilar, and contain the same matter and nearly the same wording;\nbut the latter MS. has many errors of transcription. They are\nall in French. The conjurations and wording of these are much\nfuller than in 10,862 Add. MSS. and 1202 Lansdowne MSS. The title\nis \"The Key of Solomon King of the Hebrews, translated from the\nHebrew Language into Italian by Abraham Colorno, by the order\nof his most Serene Highness of Mantua; and recently put into French.\"\nThe pentacles are much better drawn, are in coloured inks, and\nin the case of 3091 Sloane MSS., gold and silver are employed.\n\n1307 Sloane MSS. is in Italian; its title is 'La Clavicola di\nSalomone Redotta et epilogata nella nostra materna lingua del\ndottissimo Gio Peccatrix.' It is full of black magic, and is a\njumble of the Key of Solomon proper, and the two black magic books\nbefore mentioned. The pentacles are badly drawn. It, however,\ngives part of the introduction to 10,862 Add. MSS., and is the\nonly other MS. which does, save the beginning of another Italian\nversion which is bound up with the former MS., and bears the title\n'Zecorbenei.'\n\n1202 Lansdowne MSS. is 'The True Keys of King Solomon, by Armadel.'\nIt is beautifully written, with painted initial letters, and the\npentacles are carefully drawn in coloured inks. It is more concise\nin style, but omits several chapters. At the end are some short\nextracts from the Grimorium Verum with the seals of evil\nspirits, which, as they do not belong to the Key of Solomon\nproper, I have not given. For the evident classification of the\n'Key' is in two books and no more.4\n\n  \n\n  4. This additional material is titled Livre Troisieme (\"Book 3\") and\n"

For, on a certain night, when I laid\nme down to sleep, I called upon that most holy name of God, IAH,\nand prayed for the ineffable wisdom, and when I was beginning\nto close mine eyes, the angel of the Lord, even Homadiel,2 appeared\nunto me, spake many things courteously unto me, and said: Listen\nO Solomon! thy prayer before the most high is not in vain, and\nsince thou hast asked neither for long life, nor for much riches,\nnor for the souls of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself\nwisdom to perform justice. Thus saith the Lord: According to thy\nword have I given unto thee a wise and understanding heart, so\nthat before thee was none like unto thee, nor ever shall arise.\n\n  \n\n  2. Coxe 25: Gabriel; VSG: Yachiel vel Raphael; BUD256: Homachiel; Sl1307: Omadiel; Sl3847: Raziel. -JHP\n  \n\nAnd when I comprehended the speech which was made unto me, I understood\nthat in me was the knowledge of all creatures, both things which\nare in the heavens and things which are beneath the heavens; and\nI saw that all the writings and wisdom of this present age were\nvain and futile, and that no man was perfect. And I composed a\ncertain work wherein I rehearsed the secret of secrets, in which\nI have preserved them hidden, and I have also therein concealed\nall secrets whatsoever of magical arts of any masters; any secret\nor experiments, namely, of these sciences which is in any way\nworth being accomplished. Also I have written them in this Key,\nso that like as a key openeth a treasure-house, so this (Key)\nalone may open the knowledge and understanding of magical arts\nand sciences.\n\nTherefore, O my son! thou mayest see every experiment of mine\nor of others, and let everything be properly prepared for them,\nas thou shalt see properly set down by me, both day and hour,\nand all things necessary; for without this there will be but falsehood\nand vanity in this my work; wherein are hidden all secrets and\nmysteries which can be performed; and that which is (set down)\nconcerning a single divination or a single experiment, that same\nI think concerning all things which are in the Universe, and which\nhave been, and which shall be in future time.\n\nTherefore, O my son Roboam, I command thee by the blessing which\nthou expectest from thy father, that thou shall make an ivory\ncasket, and therein place, keep, and hide this my Key; and when\nI shall have passed away unto my fathers, I entreat thee to place\nthe same in my sepulchre beside me, lest at another time it might\nfall into the hands of the wicked. And as Solomon commanded, so\nwas it done.\n\nAnd when, therefore (men) had waited for a long time, there came\nunto the sepulchre certain Babylonian philosophers; and when they\nhad assembled they at once took counsel together that a certain\nnumber of men should renew the sepulchre in his (Solomon's) honour; \nand when the sepulchre was dug out and repaired the ivory casket\nwas discovered, and therein was the Key of Secrets, which they\ntook with joyful mind, and when they had opened it none among\nthem could understand it on account of the obscurity of the words\nand their occult arrangement, and the hidden character of the\nsense and knowledge, for they were not worthy to possess this\ntreasure.\n\nThen, therefore, arose one among them, more worthy (than the others),\nboth in the sight of the gods, and by reason of his age, who was\ncalled Iohé Grevis [*Toz the Greek]3, and said unto the others: Unless\nwe shall come and ask the interpretation from the Lord, with tears\nand entreaties, we shall never arrive at the knowledge of it.\n\n \n \n\n 3. I think this is correct, but the name is very\n indistinctly written in the MS., which is difficult to decipher.\n In another copy of the Clavicle it is written Iroe Grecis, but\n I think this is an error. -SLM.\n \n\n VSG p. 26: Toz grecus, I.e. Toz Graecus, or Toz the Greek, often cited as early as the 12th century. \n (See Thorndike Magic and Experimental Science II p. 226.)\n Ad. 10862 actually seems to read \"Ioè Graecus\" (Ioe the Greek).\n\n \n -JHP\n \n\nTherefore, when each of them had retired to his bed,4 Iohé\nindeed falling upon his face on the earth, began to weep, and\nstriking his breast, and said:\n\n  \n\n  4. Lat. cubiculus (bedroom). -JHP\n  \n\nWhat have I deserved (above others), seeing that so many men can\nneither understand nor interpret this knowledge, even though there\nwere no secret thing in nature which the Lord hath hidden from\nme! Wherefore are these words so obscure? Wherefore am I so ignorant?\n\nAnd then on his bended knees, stretching his hands to heaven,\nhe said:\n\nO God, the creator of all, thou who knowest all things, who gavest\nso great wisdom unto Solomon the son of David the king; grant\nunto me, I beseech thee, O holy omnipotent and ineffable Father,\nto receive the virtue of that wisdom, so that I may become worthy\nby thine aid to attain unto the understanding of this key of secrets.\n\nAnd immediately there appeared unto me,5 the angel of the Lord,\nsaying:\n\n  \n\n  5. 'Mihi' in MS., but probably a slip for 'unto him,' 'ei.' -SLM\n  \n\nDo thou remember if the secrets of Solomon appear hidden and obscure\nunto thee, that the Lord hath wished it, so that such wisdom may\nnot fall into the hands of wicked men; wherefore do thou promise\nunto me, that thou art not willing that so great wisdom should\never come to any living creature, and that which thou revealest\nunto any let them know that they must keep it unto themselves,\notherwise the secrets are profaned and no effect can follow?\n\nAnd Iohé answered: I promise unto thee that to none will\nI reveal (them), save to the honour of the Lord, and with much\ndiscipline, unto penitent, secret, and faithful (persons).\n\nThen answered the angel: Go and read the Key, and its words which\nwere obscure throughout shall be manifest unto thee.\n\nAnd after this the angel ascended into Heaven in a flame of fire.\n\nThen Iohé was glad, and labouring with a clear mind, understood\nthat which the angel of the Lord had said, and he saw that the\nKey of Solomon was changed, so that it appeared quite clear unto\nhim plainly in all parts. And Iohé understood that this\nwork might fall into the hands of the ignorant, and he said: I\nconjure him into whose hands this secret may come, by the power\nof the creator, and his wisdom, that in all things he may, desire,\nintend and perform, that this treasure may come unto no unworthy\n(person), nor may he manifest it unto any who is unwise, nor unto\none who feareth not God. Because if he act otherwise, I pray God\nthat he may never be worthy to attain unto the desired effect.\n\nAnd so he deposited the Key, which Solomon preserved, in the ivory \ncasket. But the words of the Key are as follows, divided into\ntwo books, and shown in order.6\n\n  \n\n  6. Mathers inserts the Introduction from L1203 at this point. \n  The first of these tables is found in the Zecorbeni manuscript bound with Ad. 10862, \n  in M276, Sl1307, and the Lans. MSS. The second table — names of the hours — is found in \n  L1203 (p. 17), and is apparently \n  based on Heptameron.\n  Compare with the lists of angels and demons in the \n  Magic Treatise of Solomon\n"

The order\nof the planets is as follows: \n\nShBThAI, Shabbathai, Saturn; beneath\nSaturn is TzDQ, Tzedeq, Jupiter; beneath Jupiter is MADIM, Madim,\nMars; beneath Mars is ShMSh, Shemesh, the Sun; beneath the Sun\nis NVGH, Nogah, Venus; beneath Venus is KVKB, Kokav, Mercury;\nand beneath Mercury is LBNH, Levanah, the Moon, which is the lowest\nof all the planets.\n\nIt must, therefore, be understood that the planets have their\ndominion over the day which approacheth nearest unto the name\nwhich is given and attributed unto them -- viz., over Saturday,\nSaturn; Thursday, Jupiter; Tuesday, Mars;2 Sunday, the Sun; Friday, \nVenus; Wednesday, Mercury; and Monday, the Moon.\n\n  \n\n  2. The concluding part of this sentence is from L1202. \n  K288, H3981, and Sl3091 end the sentence with \"et ainsi des autres\" \n  (and similarly for the others). -JHP\n  \n\nThe rule of the planets over each hour begins from the dawn at\nthe rising of the Sun on the day which take its name from such\nplanet, and the planet which follows it in order, succeeds to\nthe rule over the next hour. Thus (on Saturday) Saturn rules the\nfirst hour, Jupiter the second, Mars the third, the Sun the fourth,\nVenus the fifth, Mercury the sixth, the Moon the seventh, and\nSaturn returns in the rule over the eighth, and the others in\ntheir turn,3 the planets always keeping the same relative order.\n\n  \n\n  3. The rest of this sentence is in L1202 only. -JHP\n  \n\nNote that each experiment or magical operation should be performed\nunder the planet, and usually in the hour, which refers to the\nsame. For example: --\n\nIn the days and hours of Saturn thou canst perform experiments\nto summon the souls from Hades, but only of those who have died\na natural death. Similarly on these days and hours thou canst\noperate to bring either good or bad fortune to buildings; to have\nfamiliar spirits attend thee in sleep; to cause good or ill success\nin business, possessions, goods, seeds, fruits, and similar things,\nin order to acquire learning; to bring destruction and to give\ndeath, and to sow hatred and discord.\n\nThe days and hours of Jupiter are proper for obtaining honours,\nacquiring riches; contracting friendships, preserving health;\nand arriving at all that thou canst desire.\n\nIn the days and hours of Mars thou canst make experiments regarding\nwar; to arrive at military honour; to acquire courage; to overthrow\nenemies; and further to cause ruin, slaughter, cruelty, discord;\nto wound and to give death.\n\nThe days and hours of the Sun are very good for perfecting experiments\nregarding temporal wealth, hope, gain, fortune, divination, the\nfavour of princes, to dissolve hostile feeling, and to make friends.\n\nThe days and hours of Venus are good for forming friendships;\nfor kindness and love; for joyous and pleasant undertakings, and\nfor traveling.\n\nThe days and hours of Mercury are good to operate for eloquence\nand intelligence; promptitude in business; science and divination;\nwonders; apparitions; and answers regarding the future. Thou canst\nalso operate under this Planet for thefts; writings; deceit; and\nmerchandise.\n\nThe days and hours of the Moon are good for embassies; voyages;\nenvoys; messages; navigation; reconciliation; love; and the acquisition\nof merchandise by water.4\n\n  \n\n  4. Much of these foregoing instructions is omitted \n  in the 10862 Add. MSS., but given in a different way in the ensuing\n  paragraphs. -SLM\n  \n\nThou shouldest take care punctually to observe all the instructions\ncontained in this chapter, if thou desirest to succeed, seeing\nthat the truth of Magical Science dependeth thereon.\n\nThe hours of Saturn, of Mars, and of the Moon are alike good for\ncommunicating and speaking with spirits; as those of Mercury are\nfor recovering thefts by the means of spirits.\n\n[Furthermore, the hours of Saturn are appropriate for calling forth souls \nfrom the underworld, but only those which died a natural death.]*\n\nThe hours of Mars serve for summoning souls from Hades,5 especially\nof those slain in battle.\n\nThe hours of the Sun, of Jupiter, and of Venus, are adapted for\npreparing any operations whatsoever of love, of kindness, and\nof invisibility, as is hereafter more fully shown, to which must\nbe added other things of a similar nature which are contained\nin our work.\n"

But in her decrease or wane it is good for war, disturbance,\nand discord.

Latin artavus i.e. a craft or quill knife.\n  Mathers reads \"knife, the sickle, or the sword of magical art.\"\n  Ad. 10862: \"Gladium, uel Arclauum [sic].\" Gladius is generally synonymous with \n  ensis (sword), but Book 2 chapters 7 and 8 equate it with cultellus (knife). \n  Arclavus is a mistake for artavus; later the manuscript reads arctauus, while other \n  manuscripts read artavus (French 'artave', Italian 'artavo'). It is well attested, but an uncommon term; \n  Mathers follows the French manuscripts in mistranslating this as \"sickle.\" \n  See also Book 2, Chapter 8. \n  This section does not occur in Aub. 24. -JHP\n  \n \n  6. Mathers: knife or with the sickle of art. -JHP\n  \n\n  7. i.e. two circles enclosed between three circumferential lines. -SLM\n  \n\n  8. i.e. within the first circle. -SLM\n  \n\n  9. i.e. the four cardinal points of the compass. -SLM\n  \n\n  10. The letter Tau represents the cross, and in 10862\n  Add. MSS. in the drawing of the circle, the Hebrew letter is replaced\n  by the cross; In 1307 Sloane MSS. by the T or Tau-Cross. -SLM\n  \n\n  11. i.e. in the outer circle, bounded by the\n  second and third circumferential lines. -SLM\n  \n\n  12. 10862 Add. MSS. is the only copy which uses the\n  word hexagonal, but the others show four hexagrams in the\n  drawing; in the drawing, however, 10862 gives the hexagrams formed\n  by various differing interlacements of two triangles, as shown\n  in Figure 2. -SLM\n  \n\n  Note the interlacements mentioned by Mathers.  Mathers gives the names\n  in Hebrew characters; these are also given in Ad. 10862 but in considerably \n  corrupted form (see below).\n\n  The words in the middle, \"Orien.\" (East), \"Merid.\" (South)\n  \"Occid.\" (West), and \"Septen.\" (North) indicate the orientation of the \n  circle relative to the compass.  Note also the misspelling \"Tetagramaton\" \n  for \"Tetragrammaton.\"\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  Mich. 276 shows the Hebrew letter Tau in place of the 4 crosses. \n  (Mathers' version of the drawing uses both crosses and Taus.)\n  Like Harl. 5596, the circle surrounding that has \n  pentagrams (or pentalphas) in place of the interlaced triangles of Ad. 10862. \n  These are between the sacred names EHEIIE, ELIION, ELOA, IEOVA. In the square \n  instead of *Tetragrammaton repeated 8 times, M276 and W show the 12 permutations of the \n  4 letters: (South) IHVH IVHH IHHV, (East) HIVH HIHV HHVI, (North) VIHH VHIH VHIH. \n  (West) HHIV HVIH HVHI.  The circles for the censor pots (\"olla\" in Latin and Italian) \n  are drawn with double circles as in Mathers.  The sacred names El, Adonay, Jah, and Agla are \n  drawn between the circles (as in Kings 288). They also show the entrance and path \n  to the circle (\"strada per entrare nel circolo\") similar to Harl. 5596. \n  The four cardinal directions are also noted -- \"settentrione, mezzogiorno, oriente, occident\" \n  (North, South, East, West).\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  The magic circle in the Magical Treatise of Solomon also shows \n  pentagrams.  It also show an entrance to the circle, with the magic knife \n  blocking it.

See my Kabbalah Unveiled. -SLM\n  \n\n  Ad. 10862 is the only one to give these names in Hebrew characters\n  (see figure below.) Mathers follows the French manuscripts, which seem to \n  confuse the paragraph.\n  Ad. 10862 reads: \"between the East and the South, the supreme name \n  [illegible Hebrew; it does not look like IHVH.

The MSS. vary as to the point whereat each name\n  is to be placed, but I think the above will be found to answer. -SLM\n  \n\n  Ad. 10862 gives these names in corrupted Roman and Hebrew characters, but \n  they correspond to East=EL, West=Iah, South=AGLA, North=Adonay.\n\n  Kings 288 reads, \"à l'orient El, à L'occident Agla, au Midi Iah, au Septentrion Adonay\"\n  (at the East EL, at the West Agla, at the South Iah, at the North Adonay), but the \n  drawing corresponds with Ad, 10862 (see figure 2 from Kings 288 above).\n\n  L1202 text and drawing agree with \"à L'Orient Agla, au Midi, Adonay, à L'Occident, El, \n  au Septentrion Ah\" (at the East Agla, at the South Adonay, at the West El, at the North Ah).\n  The circles in Sl. 1307 and Ad. 36674 are quite different. \n  \n\n  The following paragraphs (up to \"Let the master now arise and place upon his head a crown\") \n  are not found in Aub. 24 or Ad. 10862.  Similarly Mich. 276 is missing the same material, \n  except for the list of Psalms and the prayer \"I beseech thee, O Lord\".\n-JHP\n  \n\nBetween the two squares the name Tetragrammaton is to be written\nin the same way as is shown in the plate. (See Figure 2.)\n\nWhile constructing the circle, the master should recite the following\nPsalms:—16\n\n(Ps2=KJV2) Quare fremuerunt gentes (Why do the heathen rage....)\n\n(Ps53=KJV54) Deus in nomine tuo salvum (Save me, O God, by thy name....)\n\n(Ps112=KJV113) Laudate pueri Dominum (Praise ye the Lord.

The one on fol. 36v is like that in Ad. 10862.  \n  The one on fol. 74r is similar, but adds inside the inner circle the words \n  \"Quis in fortibus ut tu Deus Tetragrammaton\".\n  It also adds a third circle around the others, with the names and symbols of the four Kings between the \n  two outer circles: Asmodel in the East, Amaymon in the South, Paymon in the West, and Aegym in the North.\n  \n\n  The name Agiel seems to be out of place here, as all the others are names of God.\n  Dresd. 91 p. 127 reads Agios instead.\n  BnF Ital. 1524 (dated 1446) suggests another possibility. It reads ELION in that place \n  (along with IOT HE VAV + LAIAIA + ADONAY).

Then you \nmay begin to perform the said experiment, which you may complete at \nany time that has been noted, but if the time and day are not mentioned, \nuse those discussed in the chapter on the hours. And if the experiment \nrequires an image of wax, or any other material, you must prepare it \nspecially as described in the chapter on the same (Book II, chapter 18). \nAfterwards you should say the following words over the matter prepared:\n\nNoga, Jes, Asropolim, Asmo, Couau, Zed�, Vesabaday, Serim, Emis, Liuaria, Eurim, \nBabus, Jasator, Jehi, Pirus, Theut, Vereset, Lanistarod, Ladonay, Eritret, Viloparas, \nTamis, Astropiel, Seriel, Accoponiel, Lucontaphoras, Latisten, Omoratos, Epicharmas, \nSophtorim, Pironias, Sonotrabas, Bislorium, Inopason, Necopolites, Vsion, Omas, \nCados, Moas, Sophina, Amos, Tratos, Soma, Inaso, Jesel, Aby, Galien, Inauis, \nAstartem, Astanimin, Darauicies, Affacum, Ara, Meli, Egeriel, Artabael, Biliach, \nBoncifal, Osau, Arari, Zeuper, Mador, Ariel, Zeuiet, Alnina, Latisten, Belfer, \nEmulzard, Aglato, Ton, Ely, Phatexion, Zelatente, Pumaton, Tucon, Nastrashit, \nMeri, Meauel, Genitu, Lerphoram, Caribom, Sugam, Acenide, Calrmi, Zacmeni, \nBermona, Caaglaot, Temptator, Somniator, Accusator.\n\nI conjure you, all you ministers of love and fornication, him who cast you down \nto Hell, and through all his names which daily bind you, that you consecrate and \nconfirm this wax here present, that it may have the desired virtue which it should \npotently gain, through the power and might of the most holy Adonay, whose \nMalkuth (Kingdom) endures through the ages of the ages. Amen.\n\nHaving completed these things, form the image as described in the experiment, \nand if it is necessary to write on the image, use the needle or quill pen and ink \nof the Art. If incensing or other observances are required, see the instructions \nin the relevant chapters. And if an invocation should be made, let it be as \nspecified above, and at the end of your conjurations, make the fumigation, \nand hold the image over the smoke, saying:\n\nO Oriens, distinguished king who reigns and rules in the East, whose rule and kingdom \nhad its beginning in the ages, and will last until the end of the ages.\n\nO Paymon, mighty king who rules in the western part of the sky.\n\nO Egym, strong king, whose kingdom and rule extends to the icy North.\n\nO Amaymon, most noble king whose domain is in the South.\n\nI powerfully invoke and arduously implore you, through him who spoke, and it was done, and who with a word alone created all, and whom all the creation obeys, through the seat of that majesty, through his will and his name, which existed before the ages were created, and who is described in four letters, Iod, He, Vau, He, and through all the Canderias, and their virtues, and through the emblems, and the names of the Creator, so that this image here present may be appropriately consecrated and formed, that it may obtain the desired virtue. Through the most holy name Adonay, whose virtue has no beginning, and will have no end.\n\nThis done, conjure again using the conjuration specified in the experiment itself, and if the woman arrives that very hour it is well. If however she doesn�t appear, put the image under the head of your bed, and within three days you will see a great wonder, for the woman will come to you at once, or else will send a message to you.\n\nIf the image is painted, or engraved in any metal, or cast in lead or tin, let it be done as said, and if the experiment requires characters or names to be written or painted, use the paper, needle, quill pen and colours (or else ink), as described in the appropriate places, observing the days and hours, and all the necessary solemnities required by the experiment.\n\nIf however the experiment requires you to touch the loved-one, or put some brief (short summary or \nletter), or similar thing under the threshold or other place which the woman must pass, if the \nexperiment requires some dust to be made and strewn about, or requires something to be drunk \nor eaten, make sure to solemnly observe the hours , times, materials, and tools, as described in \nthe relevant chapters. Afterwards, say the following oration over the dust to be scattered, or  \nthings to be drunk or eaten:\n\nIn whichever part of the world you may be, and by whatever names you may be called, \nI conjure and appeal to you, O daemons who have the power to be overturn the hearts \nof men and women, through the one who created you out of  nothing, that this night \nyou immediately convene without delay, face to face, [exerting your influence (?)] over \nthis thing, that it become consecrated, so that thereby it may accept the virtue of binding \n[or gently drawing]2 all men and women that I desire, with love for me. \n\nThen perform those things described in the experiment, and with the experiment written \nwith figures and characters in the name of whichever person, and such that she passes over it. \nOnce the characters, figure, image of wax or other materials has been prepared or inscribed, \nsay over those things the following conjuration:\n\nI conjure you Anael, Renquel [or Donquel],3 Teliel, \nprinces of love, and whomever of your ministers that have the power to ignite \npassion for men and women, and kindle them with the fires of love. I conjure you, \nI say, through him who sits above the cherubim contemplating the abyss, and \nthrough him who makes the world tremble, and whom all creations obey, \n........................4\n\nso that she will choose me, and fall in love with me, desires me,  yearn for me, burn for me, \nand care little for all others, and the whole of her thoughts may be always on me.\n\nAfterwards bury the experiment in the crossroad, then complete the experiment [and you will see the truth].5\n\n  \n\n1.

Then, in the secret place, pick it, using incense, and saying this oration over it.\n\nO God almighty who created the Earth, and you yourself marvellously laboured to make Eve from Adam�s side, who just as she had given him the fruit to eat, she caused him to sin; make it also that she who will eat or touch this fruit, will do my will always.\n\nI conjure you, O fruit, through him who made you, and through these most sacred names EL, ELOHIM, ELOHA, EHEIE ASHER EHEIE, and through the three princes of the angels of Paradise, Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael, and through all the heavens and host of angels.\n\n Likewise through the strength of God and his ineffable names, namely, JOD, HE, VAU, HE, JAH, AGLA, PRIMATON, SADAY, JAH, JAH, JAH, EL, EL, EL, ENSOPH, who created all things, and even the ages in the beginning of the ages, make it such that she who will eat or touch this fruit may have no rest, unless she completely fulfils my will.\n\nI conjure you likewise O fruit, through Kether, through Hochma, through Binah, and through all the ten Sephiroth, and also through all demons of the infernal abyss, that she (or he) to whom I will give or show you, or have touch you, may she be inflamed with the fire of  love for me, so that she will not rest, unless she completely fulfils my will.\n\nAnd if you have to write anything on the fruit, follow the teachings of this art.3\n\nYou can also make other experiments of love, which involve gazing at the sight and eyes of the woman.

If thou invokest the spirits\nby virtue of these pentacles, they will obey thee without repugnance,\nand having considered them they will be struck with astonishment,\nand will fear them, and thou shalt see them so surprised by fear\nand terror, that none of them will be sufficiently bold to wish\nto oppose thy will. They are also of great virtue and efficacy\nagainst all perils of earth, of air, of water, and of fire, against\npoison which hath been drunk, against all kinds of infirmities\nand necessities, against binding, sortilege, and sorcery, against\nall terror and fear, and wheresoever thou shalt find thyself,\nif armed with them, thou shalt be in safety all the days of thy\nlife.\n\nThrough them do we acquire grace and good-will from man and woman,\nfire is extinguished, water is stayed, and all creatures fear\nat the sight of the names which are therein, and obey through\nthat fear.\n\nThese pentacles are usually made of the metal the most suitable\nto the nature of the planet; and then there is no occasion to\nobserve the rule of particular colours. They should be engraved\nwith the instrument of art in the days and hours proper to the\nplanet.\n\nSaturn ruleth over lead; Jupiter over tin; Mars over iron; the \nSun over gold; Venus over copper; Mercury over the mixture of \nmetals; and the Moon over silver.1\n\n  \n\n  1.

This paragraph does not occur in Aub24, Ad. 10862, Sl. 1307, \n  or L1202. -JHP\n  \n\nThe matter of which the pentacle is constructed should be virgin,\nnever having been used for any other purpose; or if it be metal\nit should be purified by fire.\n\nAs regards the size of the pentacles it is arbitrary, so long\nas they are made according to the rules, and with the requisite\nsolemnities as hath been ordained.4\n\n  \n\n  4. Mathers inserts a section of L1203 at this point:\n  \"The virtues of the holy pentacles ... never descend into oblivion.\" -JHP\n  \n\nAdore5 and revere the most holy names of God which are found\nin these pentacles and characters, for without this never shalt\nthou be able to come to the end of any enterprise, nor to accomplish\nthe Mystery of Mysteries.\n\n  \n\n  5. The rest of the chapter is from 1202 Lansdowne MSS. -SLM\n  \n\nAbove all things, remember that to perform any of these operations\nthou must be pure in body and mind, and without blemish, and omit\nnot any of the preparations.\n\nThis Key, full of mysteries, hath been revealed unto me by an angel.\n\nAccursed be he who undertaketh our art without having the qualities\nrequisite to thoroughly understand our Key, accursed be he who\ninvoketh the name of God in vain, for such an one prepareth for\nhimself the punishments which await the unbelievers, for God shall\nabandon them and relegate them unto the depths of Hell amongst\nthe impure spirits.\n\nFor God is great and immutable; he hath been for ever, and he\nshall remain even unto the end of the ages.\n"

This is the ninteenth pentacle in Ad. 10862, but the 30th in Aub. 24. \n  Aub. 24, Bud 256, and Sl. 1307 all read \"Jovis\" (\"Jupiter\") (as does VMN), while \n  Ad. 10862, Mich 276, and W4668 all read \"venere\" (\"Venus\").  \n  \n\n  In place of Monachiel, VMN and Bud 256 specify the angel as Sabeyol.\n  \n\n  The verse reads \"dixit eloim crescite et multiplicamini\n"

The other letters form the names\n  of spirits of Venus, e.g.:— Schii, Eli, Ayib, etc. The\n  versicle is from Genesis ii. 23, 24:— 'This is bone of my bones,\n  and flesh of my flesh.

The characters\n  are those of the 'Passing of the River.' The surrounding versicle\n  is from Psalm xxii. 14:— 'My heart is like wax, it is melted\n  in the midst of my bowels.' -SLM\n  \n\n  The name at the bottom should read 'AL GBR', not 'AL GBL' as Colorno and Mathers.\n  This is the 35th pentacle in Aub24, and the 12th in W.\n  The verse reads, \"inflammatum est cor meum et renes mei commutati sunt et ego ad nihilum redactus sum.\" (Ps72.21)\n  None of the rest of the pentacles occur in Ad. 10862. -JHP\n"

          "text": "PREFACE\n\n \nThis translation of the FIRST BOOK of the \"Lemegeton\" which is now for the first time made accessible to students of TALISMANIC MAGIC was done, after careful collation and edition, from numerous Ancient Manuscripts in Hebrew, Latin, and French, by G. H. Fra. D.D.C.F., by the order of the Secret Chief of the Rosicrucian Order. 1 The G. H. Fra., having succumbed unhappily to the assaults of the Four Great Princes (acting notably under Martial influences), it seemed expedient that the work should be brought to its conclusion by another hand. The investigation of a competent Skryer into the house of our unhappy Fra., confirmed this divination; neither our Fra. nor his Hermetic Mul. were there seen; but only the terrible shapes of the evil Adepts S.V.A. 2 and H., whose original bodies having\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \np. 4\n\n \nbeen sequestered by Justice, were no longer of use to them. On this we stayed no longer Our Hand; but withdrawing Ourselves, and consulting the Rota, and the Books M. and Q. did decide to ask Mr. Aleister Crowley, a poet, and skilled student of Magical Lore, and an expert Kabbalist, to complete openly that which had been begun in secret. 1 This is that which is written: \"His Bishoprick let another take.\" And again: \"Oculi Tetragammaton.\" This is also that which is said: \"Nomen Secundum refertur ad Gebhurah; qui est Rex Bittul atque Corruptio Achurajim Patris et Matris hoc indigitatur.\"\n\n \nAnd so saying we wish you well.\n\n \n \n \nEx Deo Nascimur.\n\n In Jesu Morimur.\n\n Per S.S. Reviviscimus.\n\n \n \n \nGiven forth from our Mountain of A.,\n\n \nthis day of C.C. 1903 A. D.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFootnotes\n\n \n3:1 Mr. A. E. Waite writes (\"Real History Of The Rosicrucians,\" p. 426): \"I beg leave to warn my readers that all persons who proclaim themselves to be Rosicrucians are simply members of pseudo-fraternities, and that there is that difference between their assertion and the fact of the case in which the essence of a lie consists!\" It is within the Editor's personal knowledge that Mr. Waite was (and still is probably) a member of a society claiming to be the R.C. fraternity As Mr. Waite constantly hints in his writing that he is in touch with initiated centres, I think the syllogism, whose premises are given above, is fair, if not quite formal.--ED.\n\n \n3:2 It was owing to our Fra. receiving this S.V.A. as his Superior, and giving up the Arcana of our Fraternity into so unhallowed a power, that We decided no longer to leave Our dignity and authority in the hands of one who could be thus easily imposed upon. (For by a childish and easy magical trick did S.V.A. persuade D.D.C.F. of that lie.)\n\n \n4:1 He that is appointed to complete in secret that which had been begun openly is R.R., and to be heard of at the care of the Editor.\n"

          "text": "THE INITIATED INTERPRETATION OF CEREMONIAL MAGIC.\n\n \nIt is loftily amusing to the student of Magical literature who is not quite a fool--and rare is such a combination!--to note the criticism directed by the Philistine against the citadel of his science. Truly, since our childhood has ingrained into us not only literal belief in the Bible, but also substantial belief in Alf Laylah wa Laylah, and only adolescence can cure us, we are only too liable, in the rush and energy of dawning manhood, to overturn roughly and rashly both these classics, to regard them both on the same level, as interesting documents from the standpoint of folk-lore and anthropology, and as nothing more.\n\n \nEven when we learn that the Bible, by a profound and minute study of the text, may be forced to yield up Qabalistic arcana of cosmic scope and importance, we are too often slow to apply a similar restorative to the companion volume, even if we are the luck holders of Burton's veritable edition.\n\n \np. 10\n\n \nTo me, then, it remains to raise the Alf Laylah wa Laylah into its proper place once more.\n\n \nI am not concerned to deny the objective reality of all \"magical\" phenomena; if they are illusions, they are at least as real as many unquestioned facts of daily life; and, if we follow Herbert Spencer, they are at least evidence of some cause. 1\n\n \nNow, this fact is our base. What is the cause of my illusion of seeing a spirit in the triangle of Art?\n\n \nEvery smatterer, every expert in psychology, will answer: \"That cause lies in your brain.\"\n\n \nEnglish children (pace the Education Act) are taught that the Universe lies in infinite Space; Hindu children, in the Akasa, which is the same thing.\n\n \nThose Europeans who go a little deeper learn from Fichte, that the phenomenal Universe is the creation of the Ego; Hindus, or Europeans studying under Hindu Gurus, are told, that by Akasa is meant the Chitakasa. The Chitakasa is situated in the \"Third Eye,\" i.e., in the brain. By assuming higher dimensions of space, we can assimilate this fact to Realism; but we have no need to take so much trouble.\n\n \nThis being true for the ordinary Universe, that all sense-impressions are dependent on changes in the brain, 2 we must include illusions, which are after all sense-impressions as much as \"realities\" are, in the class of \"phenomena dependent on brain-changes.\"\n\n \nMagical phenomena, however, come under a special sub-class, since they are willed, and their cause is the series of \"real\" phenomena, called the operations of ceremonial Magic.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \np. 11\n\n \nThese consist of\n\n \n(1) Sight.\n\n The circle, square, triangle, vessels, lamps, robes, implements, etc.\n\n \n(2) Sound.\n\n The invocations.\n\n \n(3) Smell.\n\n The perfumes.\n\n \n(4) Taste.\n\n The Sacraments.\n\n \n(5) Touch.\n\n As under (1).\n\n \n(6) Mind.\n\n \nThe combination of all these and reflection on their significance.\n\n \nThese unusual impressions (1-5) produce unusual brain-changes; hence their summary (6) is of unusual kind. Its projection back into the apparently phenomenal world is therefore unusual.\n\n \nHerein then consists the reality of the operations and effects of ceremonial magic, 1 and I conceive that the apology is ample, as far as the \"effects\" refer only to those phenomena which appear to the magician himself, the appearance of the spirit, his conversation, possible shocks from imprudence, and so on, even to ecstasy on the one hand, and death or madness on the other.\n\n \nBut can any of the effects described in this our book Goetia be obtained, and if so, can you give a rational explanation of the circumstances? Say you so?\n\n \nI can, and will.\n\n \nThe spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human brain.\n\n \n\n \n\n \np. 12\n\n \nTheir seals therefore represent (Mr. Spencer's projected cube) methods of stimulating or regulating those particular spots (through the eye).\n\n \nThe names of God are vibrations calculated to establish:\n\n \n(a) General control of the brain., (Establishment of functions relative to the subtle world.)\n\n \n(b) Control over the brain in detail. (Rank or type of the Spirit.)\n\n \n(c) Control of one special portion. (Name of the Spirit.)\n\n \nThe perfumes aid this through smell. Usually the perfume will only tend to control a large area; but there is an attribution of perfumes to letters of the alphabet enabling one, by a Qabalistic formula, to spell out the Spirit's name.\n\n \nI need not enter into more particular discussion of these points; the intelligent reader can easily fill in what is lacking.\n\n \nIf, then, I say, with Solomon:\n\n \n\"The Spirit Cimieries teaches logic,\" what I mean is:\n\n \n\"Those portions of my brain which subserve the logical faculty may be stimulated and developed by following out the processes called 'The Invocation of Cimieries.'\"\n\n \nAnd this is a purely materialistic rational statement; it is independent of any objective hierarchy at all. Philosophy has nothing to say; and Science can only suspend judgment, pending a proper and methodical investigation of the facts alleged.\n\n \nUnfortunately, we cannot stop there. Solomon promises us that we can (1) obtain information; (2) destroy our enemies; (3) understand the voices of nature; (4) obtain treasure; (5) heal diseases, etc. I have taken\n\n \np. 13\n\n \nthese five powers at random; considerations of space forbid me to explain all.\n\n \n(1) Brings up facts from sub-consciousness.\n\n \n(2) Here we come to an interesting fact. It is curious to note the contrast between the noble means and the apparently vile ends of magical rituals. The latter are disguises for sublime truths. \"To destroy our enemies\" is to realize the illusion of duality, to excite compassion.\n\n \n(Ah! Mr. Waite, the world of Magic is a mirror, wherein who sees muck is muck.)\n\n \n(3) A careful naturalist will understand much from the voices of the animals he has studied long. Even a child knows the difference of a cat's miauling and purring. The faculty may be greatly developed.\n\n \n(4) Business capacity may be stimulated.\n\n \n(5) Abnormal states of the body may be corrected, and the involved tissues brought back to tone, in obedience to currents started from the brain.\n\n \nSo for all other phenomena. There is no effect which is truly and necessarily miraculous.\n\n \nOur Ceremonial Magic fines down, then, to a series of minute, though of course empirical, physiological experiments, and whoso, will carry them through intelligently need not fear the result.\n\n \nI have all the health, and treasure, and logic, I need; I have no time to waste. \"There is a lion in the way.\" For me these practices are useless; but for the benefit of others less fortunate I give them to the world, together with this explanation of, and apology for, them.\n\n \nI trust that the explanation will enable many students who have hitherto, by a puerile objectivity in their view of the question, obtained no results, to succeed; that the apology may impress upon our scornful men of science that the study of the bacillus should give place to that\n\n \np. 14\n\n \nof the baculum, the little to the great--how great one only realizes when one identifies the wand with the Mahalingam, up which Brahma flew at the rate of 84,000 yojanas a second for 84,000 mahakalpas, down which Vishnu flew at the rate of 84,000 croces of yojanas a second for 84,000 crores of mahakalpas--yet neither reached an end.\n\n \nBut I reach an end.\n\n \nBoleskine House,\n\n     Foyers, N.B.\n\n \n\n \nFootnotes\n\n \n10:1 This, incidentally, is perhaps the greatest argument we possess, pushed to its extreme, against the Advaitist theories.\n\n \n10:2 Thought is a secretion of the brain (Weissmann). Consciousness is a function of the brain (Huxley).\n"

Whence magicians are profound and diligent searchers into Nature; they, because of their skill, know how to anticipate an effort, 4 the which to the vulgar shall seem to be a miracle.\n\n \nOrigen saith that the Magical Art doth not contain anything subsisting, but although it should, yet that it must not be Evil, or subject to contempt or scorn; and doth distinguish the Natural Magic from that which is Diabolical.\n\n \nApollonius Tyannaeus only exercised the Natural Magic, by the which he did perform wonderful things.\n\n \nPhilo Hebraeus saith that true Magic, by which we do arrive at the understanding of the Secret Works of Nature, is so far from being contemptible that the greatest Monarchs and Kings have studied it. Nay! among the Persians none might reign unless he was skilful in this GREAT ART.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \np. 16\n\n \nThis Noble Science often degenerateth, from Natural becometh Diabolical, and from True Philosophy turneth unto Nigromancy. 1 The which is wholly to be charged upon its followers, who, abusing or not being capable of that High and Mystical Knowledge do immediately hearken unto the temptations of Sathan, and are misled by him into the Study of the Black Art. Hence it is that Magic lieth under disgrace, and they who seek after it are vulgarly esteemed Sorcerers.\n\n \nThe Fraternity of the Rosie Crusians thought it not fit to style themselves Magicians, but rather Philosophers. And they be not ignorant Empiricks, 2 but learned and experienced Physicians, whose remedies be not only Lawful but Divine.\n"

He ruleth over 66 Legions of Infernal Spirits. He appeareth in divers shapes, sometimes like a Cat, sometimes like a Toad, and sometimes like a Man, and sometimes all these forms at once. He speaketh hoarsely. This is his character which is used to be worn as a Lamen before him who calleth him forth, or else he will not do thee homage.\n\n \n(2.) \n  AGARES.--The Second Spirit is a Duke called Agreas, or Agares. He is under the Power of the East, and cometh up in the form of an old fair Man, riding upon a Crocodile, carrying a Goshawk upon his fist, and yet mild in appearance. He maketh them to run that stand still, and bringeth back runaways. He teaches all Languages or Tongues presently. He hath power also to destroy Dignities both Spiritual and Temporal, and causeth Earthquakes. He was of the Order of Virtues. He hath under his government 31 Legions of Spirits. And this is his Seal or Character which thou shalt wear as a Lamen before thee.\n\n \n(3.) \n  VASSAGO.--The Third Spirit is a Mighty Prince, being of the same nature as Agares. He is called Vassago. This Spirit is of a Good Nature, and his office is to declare things Past and to Come, and to discover all things Hid or Lost. And he governeth 26 Legions of Spirits, and this is his Seal.\n\n \n(4.) \n  SAMIGINA, or GAMIGM.--The Fourth Spirit is Samigina, a Great Marquis. He appeareth in the form\n\n \np. 23\n\n \nof a little Horse or Ass, and then into Human shape doth he change himself at the request of the Master. He speaketh with a hoarse voice. He ruleth over 30 Legions of Inferiors. He teaches all Liberal Sciences, and giveth account of Dead Souls that died in sin. And his Seal is this, which is to be worn before the Magician when he is Invocator, etc.\n\n \n(5.) \n  MARBAS.--The fifth Spirit is Marbas. He is a Great President, and appeareth at first in the form of a Great Lion, but afterwards, at the request of the Master, he putteth on Human Shape. He answereth truly of things Hidden or Secret. He causeth Diseases and cureth them. Again, he giveth great Wisdom and Knowledge in Mechanical Arts; and can change men into other shapes. He governeth 36 Legions of Spirits. And his Seal is this, which is to be worn as aforesaid.\n\n \n(6.) \n  VALEFOR.--The Sixth Spirit is Valefor. He is a mighty Duke, and appeareth in the shape of a Lion with an Ass's Head, bellowing. He is a good Familiar, but tempteth them he is a familiar of to steal. He governeth 10 Legions of Spirits. His Seal is this, which is to be worn, whether thou wilt have him for a Familiar, or not.\n\n \n(7.) \n  AMON.--The Seventh Spirit is Amon. He is a Marquis great in power, and most stern. He appeareth like a Wolf with a Serpents tail, vomiting out of his mouth flames of fire; but at the command of the Magician he putteth on the shape of a Man with Dog's teeth beset in a head like a Raven; or else like a Man with a Raven's head (simply). He telleth all things Past and to Come. He procureth feuds and reconcileth controversies between friends. He governeth 40 Legions of Spirits. His Seal is this which is to be worn as aforesaid, etc.\n\n \n(8.) \n  BARBATOS.--The Eighth Spirit is Barbatos. He is a Great Duke, and appeareth when the Sun is in Sagittary,\n\n \np. 24\n\n \nwith four noble Kings and their companies of great troops. He giveth understanding of the singing of Birds, and of the Voices of other creatures, such as the barking of Dogs. He breaketh the Hidden Treasures open that have been laid by the Enchantments of Magicians. He is of the Order of Virtues, of which some part he retaineth still; and he knoweth all things Past, and to come, and conciliateth Friends and those that be in Power. He ruleth over 30 Legions of Spirits. His Seal of Obedience is this, the which wear before thee as aforesaid.\n\n \n(9) \n  \n  PAIMON.--The Ninth Spirit in this Order is Paimon, a Great King, and very obedient unto LUCIFER. He appeareth in the form of a Man sitting upon a Dromedary with a Crown most glorious upon his head. There goeth before him also an Host of Spirits, like Men with Trumpets and well sounding Cymbals, and all other sorts of Musical Instruments. He hath a great Voice, and roareth at his first coming, and his speech is such that the Magician cannot well understand unless he can compel him. This Spirit can teach all Arts and Sciences, and other secret things. He can discover unto thee what the Earth is, and what holdeth it up in the Waters; and what Mind is, and where it is; or any other thing thou mayest desire to know.

KNIGHTS.--(50.) Furcas.\n\n \nNOTE.--It will be remarked that several among the above Spirits possess two titles of different ranks; e.g., (45.) Viné is both King and Earl; (25.) Glasya-Labolas is both President and Earl, etc. \"Prince\" and \"Prelate\" are apparently used as interchangeable terms. Probably the Seals of Earls should be made of Iron, and those of Presidents in mixture either of Copper and Silver, or of Silver and Mercury; as otherwise the Metal of one Planet, Mars, is excluded from the List; the Metals attributed to the Seven Planets being: to Saturn, Lead; to Jupiter, Tin; to Mars, Iron; to the Sun, Gold; to Venus, Copper; to Mercury, Mercury and mixtures of Metals, and to Luna, Silver.\n\n \nIN a manuscript codex by Dr. Rudd, which is in the British Museum, Hebrew names of these 72 Spirits are given; but it appears to me that many are manifestly incorrect in orthography. The codex in question, though beautifully written, also contains many other errors, particularly in the Sigils. Such as they are, these names in\n\n \np. 49\n\n \nthe Hebrew of Dr. Rudd are here shown. (See Figures 81 to 152 inclusive. \n )\n"

The square in the centre of the circle, where the word \"Master\" is written, is filled in with red. All names and letters are in black. In the Hexagrams the outer triangles where the letters A, D, O, N, A, I, appear are filled in with bright yellow, the centres, where the T-shaped crosses are, blue or green. In the Pentagrams outside the circle, the outer triangles where \"Te, tra, gram, ma, ton,\" is written, are filled in bright yellow, and the centres with the T crosses written therein are red. 1)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFootnotes\n\n \n49:1 The coiled serpent is only shown in one private codex, the Hebrew names being in most cases simply written round in a somewhat spiral arrangement within the double circle. It is to be remembered that Hebrew is always written from right to left, p. 50 instead of from left to right like ordinary European languages. The small Maltese crosses are placed to mark the conclusion of each separate set of Hebrew names. These names are those of Deity Angels and Archangels allotted by the Qabalists to each of the 9 first Sephiroth or Divine Emanations. In English letters they run thus, beginning from the head of the serpent: ✠ Ehyeh Kether Metatron Chaioth Ha-Qadehs Rashith Ha-Galgalim S.P.M. (for \"Sphere of the Primum Mobile\") ✠ Iah Chokmah Ratziel Auphanim Masloth S.S.F (for \"Sphere of the Fixed Stars,\" or S.Z. for \"Sphere of the Zodiac\") ✠ Iehovah Eolhim, Binah Tzadquiel Aralim Shabbathai S.

Note that on this night the moon must be increasing in light (i.e., going from new to full) and in the Zodiacal Sign of Virgo. And when the seal is so made thou shalt perfume it with alum, raisins dried in the sun, dates, cedar and lignum aloes.\n\n \nAlso, by this seal King Solomon did command all the aforesaid Spirits in the Vessel of Brass, and did seal it up with this same seal. He by it gained the love of all manner of persons, and overcame in battle, for neither weapons, nor fire, nor water could hurt him. And this\n\n \np. 53\n\n \nprivy seal was made to cover the vessel at the top withal, etc.\n\n \nNote: Figures 162 to 174 inclusive are interesting as showing a marked resemblance to the central design of the Secret Seal. It will be observed that the evident desire is to represent hieroglyphically a person raising his or her hands in adoration. Nearly all are stone sepulchral steles, and the execution of them is rough and primitive in the extreme. Most are in the Musëe du Louvre at Paris.\n\n \nFigures 162 \n  and 163 \n  are from the district of Constantine and show a figure raising its arms in adoration.\n"

Above is a hieroglyphic representing either the Lunar Disc or the Sun in the heavens; but more probably the former.\n\n \nFigure 165 \n  is a more complicated stele. Above is the symbol already mentioned, then comes the sign of the Pentagram, represented by a five-pointed star, towards which the person raises his or her hands. Besides the latter is a rude form of caduceus. A brief inscription follows in the Punic character. The Punic or Carthaginian language is usually considered to have been a dialect. of Phœnician, and Carthage was of course a colony of Tyre. Beneath the Tunic inscription is a horse's head in better drawing than the sculpture of the rest of the stele, which would seem to imply that the rudeness of the representation of the human figure is intentional. This and the following stele are also from Constantine.\n"

In addition to the other symbols there is either a hand or a foot, for it is almost impossible to distinguish which, at the head of the stele, followed by an egg-and-tongue moulding. The figure of the person with the\n\n \np. 54\n\n \narms raised is treated as a pure hieroglyphic and is placed between two rude caducei. The Lunar or Solar Symbol follows.\n\n \nFigure 167 \n , also from Constantine, shows the last-mentioned symbol above. The figure with the arms raised is simply a hieroglyph, and is placed between an arm and hand on the one side, and a rude caduceus on the other.\n\n \nFigure 168 \n shows the person holding a rude caduceus in the right hand, and standing above a dolphin. This latter, as in the case of the horse in 165 and 166, is by far the best delineated.\n\n \nFigure 169 \n , this also being from Constantine, shows the usual human hieroglyph between a caduceus and a crescent.\n\n \nFigure 170 \n  is from the site of ancient Carthage. It is very rough in workmanship, and the designs are mere scratchings on the stone. The ensemble has the effect of an evil Sigil.\n\n \nFigure 171 \n  is also from Carthage and the various symbols appear to have become compressed into and synthesised in the form of a peculiarly evil-looking caduceus.\n\n \nFigure 172 \n  is from the decoration of a sepulchral urn found at Oldenburgh in Germany. It is remarkable as showing the same hieroglyphic human form with the crescent above; the latter in the Secret Seal of Solomon has a flattened top, and is therefore more like a bowl, and is placed across the hieroglyph.\n\n \nFigure 173 \n  is an Egyptian design which would show an analogy between the symbol and the idea of the force of the creation.\n\n \nFigure 174 \n  is a stele from Phœnicia somewhat similar to the others, except that the rudimentary caducei in Figures 166 \n  and 170 \n  are here replaced by two roughly drawn Ionic columns.\n\n \np. 55\n\n \nThese last three designs are taken from the work of the Chevalier Emile Soldi-Colbert de Beaulieu, on the \"Langue Sacrée.\"\n"

I conjure and constrain thee, O thou Spirit N., by all the names aforesaid; and in addition by these seven great names wherewith Solomon the Wise bound thee and thy companions in a Vessel of Brass, ADONAI, PREYAI or PRERAI, TETRAGRAMMATON, ANAPHAXETON or ANEPHENETON, INESSENFATOAL or INESSENFATALL, PATHTUMON or PATHATUMON, and ITEMON; that thou appearest, here before this Circle to fulfil my will in all things that seem good unto me.

And I will bind thee in the Eternal Fire, and into the Lake of Flame and of Brimstone, unless thou comest quickly and appearest here before this Circle to do my will. Therefore, come thou! in and by the holy names ADONAI, ZABAOTH, ADONAI, AMIORAN. Come thou! for it is ADONAI who commandest thee.\n\n \nIF THOU hast come thus far, and yet he appeareth not, thou mayest be sure that he is sent unto some other place by his King, and cannot come; and if it be so, invocate the King as here followeth, to send him. But if he do not come still, then thou mayest be sure that he is bound in chains in hell, and that he is not in the custody of his King. If so, and thou still hast a desire to call him even from thence, thou must rehearse the general curse which is called the Spirits' Chain.\n\n \nHere followeth, therefore, the Invocation of the King: 1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFootnotes\n\n \n60:1 It will depend on the quarter to which the Spirit is attributed, which of the four chief kings are to be invoked.\n"

Yet their origin, the date of their writing, and the exact meaning of many of the verses remain one of the great literary mysteries.\n \n \nThey have come down to us in a single and very ancient document in Syriac language. Evidently that document is a translation from the original Greek. Critical debate has raged around these Odes; one of the most plausible explanations is that they are songs of newly baptized Christians of the First Century.\n \n \nThey are strangely lacking in historical allusions. Their radiance is no reflection of other days. They do not borrow from either the Old Testament or the Gospels. The inspiration of these verses is first-hand. They remind you of Aristides' remark, \"A new people with whom something Divine is mingled.\" Here is vigor and insight to which we can find parallels only in the most exalted parts of the Scriptures.\n \n \nFor these dazzling mystery odes, we owe our translation to J. Rendel Harris, MA., Hon. Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge. He says about them: \"There does not seem to be anything about which everyone seem agreed unless it be that the Odes are of singular beauty and high spiritual value.\"\n"

The original manuscript has perished but fortunately Greek translations have been preserved, and recently a Syriac version of the same songs has turned up and was published in English for the first time in 1909 by Dr. Rendel Harris.\n \n \nThe date of the writing may be established at the middle of the First Century B. C. because the theme of these songs is that of Pompey's actions in Palestine and his death in Egypt in 48 B. C.\n \n \nThese psalms had an important position and were widely circulated in the early Church. They are frequently referred to in the various Codexes and histories of the first few centuries of the Christian Era.\n \n \nLater, they became lost through inexplicable reasons; and have only been recovered for our use after the lapse of many centuries.\n \n \nBesides the literary value of the trumpet-like rhythm of these verses, we have here a chapter of stirring ancient history written by an eyewitness. Pompey comes out of the West. He uses battering-rams on the fortifications. His soldiers defile the altar. He is slain in Egypt after a fearful career. In the \"righteous\" of these psalms we see the Pharisees; in the \"sinners\" we see the Sadducees. It is an epic of a great people in the throes of a great crisis.\n"

A psalm of utter despair.\n \n \nWhen the sinner waxed proud, with a battering-ram he cast down fortified walls, p. 106\n   And thou didst not restrain him.\n Alien nations ascended Thine altar,\n   They trampled it proudly with their sandals;\n Because the sons of Jerusalem had defiled the holy things of the Lord,\n   Had profaned with iniquities the offerings of God.\n Therefore He said: Cast them far from Me;\n     .       .       .       .       .       .\n It was set at naught before God,\n   It was utterly dishonoured;\n The sons and the daughters were m grievous captivity,\n   Sealed was their neck, branded was it among the nations.\n \n \nAccording to their sins hath He done unto them,\n   For He hath left them in the hands of them that prevailed.\n He hath turned away His face from pitying them,\n   Young and old and their children together;\n For they had done evil one and all, in not hearkening.\n   And the heavens were angry,\n And the earth abhorred them;\n   For no man upon it had done what they did,\n And the earth recognized all\n   Thy righteous judgements, O God.\n They set the sons of Jerusalem to be mocked at in return for the harlots in her;\n   Every wayfarer entered in in the full light of day.\n They made mock with their transgressions, as they themselves were wont to do;\n   In the full light of day they revealed their iniquities.\n And the daughters of Jerusalem were defiled in accordance with Thy judgement,\n   Because they had defiled themselves with unnatural intercourse.\n I am pained in my bowels and my inward parts for these things.\n \n \nAnd yet I will justify Thee, O God, in uprightness of heart,\n   For in Thy judgements is Thy righteousness displayed, O God.\n For Thou hast rendered to the sinners according to their deeds,\n   Yea, according to their sins, which were very wicked.\n Thou hast uncovered their sins, that Thy judgement might be manifest;\n   Thou hast wiped out their memorial from the earth.\n God is a righteous judge,\n   And he is no respecter of persons.\n \n \nFor the nations reproached Jerusalem, trampling it down;\n   Her beauty was dragged down from the throne of glory.\n She girded on sackcloth instead of comely raiment,\n   A rope was about her head instead of a crown.\n She put off the glorious diadem which God had set upon her,\n   In dishonour was her beauty cast upon the ground.\n \n \nAnd I saw and entreated the Lord and said,\n   Long enough, O Lord has Thine hand been heavy on Israel, in bringing the nations upon them.\n For they have made sport unsparingly in wrath and fierce anger;\n   And they will make an utter end, unless Thou, O Lord, rebuke them in Thy wrath.\n For they have done. it not in zeal, but in lust of soul,\n   Pouring out their wrath upon us with a view to rapine.\n Delay not, O God, to recompense them on their heads,\n   To turn the pride of the dragon into dishonour. p. 107\n And I had not long to wait before God showed me the insolent one\n   Slain on the mountains of Egypt,\n   Esteemed of less account than the least, on land and sea;\n His body, too, borne hither and thither on the billows with much insolence,\n   With none to bury him, because He had rejected him with dishonour.\n \n \nHe reflected not that he was man,\n   And reflected not on the latter end;\n He said: I will be lord of land and sea;\n   And he recognized not that it is God who is great,\n   Mighty in His great strength.\n He is king over the heavens,\n   And judgeth kings and kingdoms.\n It is He who setteth me up in glory,\n   And bringeth down the proud to eternal destruction in dishonour,\n   Because they knew Him not.\n \n \nAnd now behold, ye princes of the earth, the judgement of the Lord,\n   For a great king and righteous is He, judging all that is under heaven.\n Bless God, ye that fear the Lord with wisdom,\n   For the mercy of the Lord will ~e upon them that fear Him, m the Judgement;\n So that He will distinguish between the righteous and the sinner,\n   And recompense the sinners for ever according to their deeds;\n And have mercy on the righteous, delivering him from the affliction of the sinner,\n   And recompensing the sinner for what he bath done to the righteous.\n For the Lord is good to them that call upon Him in patience,\n   Doing according to His mercy to His pious ones,\n   Establishing them at all times before Him in strength.\n \n \nBlessed be the Lord for ever before His servants.\n"

Come ye, enter ye in with peace.\n They made the rough ways even, before his entering in;\n   They opened the gates to Jerusalem, they crowned its walls.\n \n \nAs a father entereth the house of his sons, so he entered Jerusalem in peace;\n   He established his feet there in great safety.\n He captured her fortresses and the wall of Jerusalem;\n   For God Himself led him in safety, while they wandered.\n He destroyed their princes and every one wise in counsel;\n   He poured out the blood of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, like the water of uncleanness. p. 112\n He led away their sons and daughters, whom they had begotten in defilement.\n \n \nThey did according to their uncleanness, even as their fathers had done:\n   They defiled Jerusalem and the things that had been hallowed to the name of God.\n But God hath shown Himself righteous in His judgements upon the nations of the earth;\n   And the pious servants of God are like innocent lambs in their midst.\n Worthy to be praised is the Lord that judgeth the whole earth in His righteousness.\n \n \nBehold, now, O God, Thou hast shown us Thy judgement in Thy righteousness;\n   Our eyes have seen Thy judgements, O God.\n We have justified Thy name that is honoured for ever;\n   For Thou are the God of righteousness, judging Israel with chastening.\n \n \nTurn, O God, Thy mercy upon us, and have pity upon us;\n   Gather together the dispersed of Israel, with mercy and goodness;\n For Thy faithfulness is with us,\n And though we have stiffened our neck, yet Thou art our chastener;\n   Overlook us not, O our God, lest the nations swallow us up, as though there were none to deliver.\n \n \nBut Thou art our God from the beginning,\n   And upon Thee is our hope set, O Lord;\n And we will not depart from Thee,\n   For good are Thy judgements upon us.\n Ours and our children's be Thy good pleasure for ever;\n   O Lord, our Saviour, we shall never more be moved.\n The Lord is worthy to be praised for His judgements with the mouth of His pious ones;\n   And blessed be Israel of the Lord for ever.\n"

A poetic narrative about the utter disintegration of a great nation.\n \n \nO Lord, Thou art our King for ever and ever,\n   For in Thee, O God, doth our soul glory.\n How long are the days of man's life upon the earth?\n   As are his days, so is the hope set upon him.\n But we hope in God, our deliverer;\n For the might of our God is for ever with mercy,\n   And the kingdom of our God is for ever over the nations in judgement.\n \n \nThou, O Lord, didst choose David to be king over Israel,\n   And swaredst to him touching his seed that never should his kingdom fail before Thee.\n But, for our sins, sinners rose up against us;\n   They assailed us and thrust us out;\n   What Thou hadst not promised to them, they took away from us with violence.\n They in no wise glorified Thy honourable name;\n   They set a worldly monarchy in place of that which was their excellency;\n   They laid waste the throne of David in tumultuous arrogance.\n But Thou, O God, didst cast them down, and remove their seed from the earth,\n   In that there rose up against them a man that was alien to our race.\n According to their sins didst Thou recompense them, O God;\n   So that it befell them according to their deeds.\n God showed them no pity;\n   He sought out their seed and let not one of them go free.\n Faithful is the Lord in all His judgements\n   Which He doeth upon the earth.\n \n \nThe lawless one laid waste our land so that none inhabited it,\n   They destroyed young and old and their children together.\n In the heat of His anger He sent them away even unto the west,\n   And He exposed the rulers of the land unsparingly to derision.\n Being an alien the enemy acted proudly,\n   And his heart was alien from Our God.\n And all things whatsoever he did in Jerusalem,\n   As also the nations in the cities to their gods.\n \n \nAnd the children of the covenant in the midst of the mingled peoples surpassed them in evil.\n   There was not among them one that wrought in the midst of Jerusalem mercy and truth.\n They that loved the synagogues of the pious fled from them,\n   As sparrows that fly from their nest.\n They wandered in deserts that their lives might be saved from harm, p. 118\n   And precious in the eyes of them that lived abroad was any that escaped alive from them.\n   Over the whole earth were they scattered by lawless men.\n For the heavens withheld the rain from dropping upon the earth,\n   Springs were stopped that sprang perennially out of the deeps, that ran down from lofty mountains.\n For there was none among them that wrought righteousness and justice;\n   From the chief of them to the least of them all were sinful;\n   The king was a transgressor, and the judge disobedient, and the people sinful.\n Behold, O Lord, and raise up unto them their king, the son of David,\n   At the time in the which Thou seest, O God, that he may reign over Israel Thy servant.\n And gird him with strength, that he may shatter unrighteous rulers,\n   And that he may purge Jerusalem from nations that trample her down to destruction.\n Wisely, righteously he shall thrust out sinners from the inheritance,\n   He shall destroy the pride of the sinner as a potter's vessel.\n With a rod of iron he shall break in pieces all their substance,\n   He shall destroy the godless nations with the word of his mouth;\n At his rebuke nations shall flee before him,\n   And he shall reprove sinners for the thoughts of their heart.\n \n \nAnd he shall gather together a holy people, whom he shall lead in righteousness,\n   And he shall judge the tribes of the people that has been sanctified by the Lord his God.\n And he shall not suffer unrighteousness to lodge any more in their midst,\n   Nor shall there dwell with them any man that knoweth wickedness,\n   For he shall know them, that they are all sons of their God.\n And he shall divide them according to their tribes upon the land,\n   And neither sojourner nor alien shall sojourn with them any more.\n He shall judge peoples and nations in the wisdom of his righteousness. Selah.\n \n \nAnd he shall have the heathen nations to serve him under his yoke;\n   And he shall glorify the Lord in a place to be seen of all the earth;\n   And he shall purge Jerusalem, making it holy as of old:\n So that nations shall come from the ends of the earth to see his glory,\n   Bringing as gifts her sons who had fainted.\n   And to see the glory of the Lord, wherewith God hath glorified her.\n And he shall be a righteous king, taught of God, over them,\n And there shall be no unrighteousness in his days in their midst,\n   For all shall be holy and their king the anointed of the Lord.\n For he shall not put his trust in horse and rider and bow,\n   Nor shall he multiply for himself gold and silver for war,\n \n \nNor shall he gather confidence from a multitude for the day of battle. p. 119\n The Lord Himself is his king, the hope of him that is mighty through his hope in God.\n \n \nAll nations shall be in fear before him,\n   For he will smite the earth with the word of his mouth for ever.\n He will bless the people of the Lord with wisdom and gladness,\n   And he himself will be pure from sin, so that he may rule a great people.\n He will rebuke rulers, and remove sinners by the might of his word;\n   And relying upon his God, throughout his days he will not stumble;\n For God will make him mighty by means of His holy spirit,\n   And wise by means of the spirit of understanding, with strength and righteousness.\n And the blessing of the Lord will be with him: he will be strong and stumble not;\n   His hope will be in the Lord: who then can prevail against him?\n He will, be mighty in his works, and strong in the fear of God,\n   He will be shepherding the flock of the Lord faithfully and righteously,\n   And will suffer none among them to stumble in their pasture.\n He will lead them all aright,\n   And there will be no pride among them that any among them should be oppressed.\n This will be the majesty of the king of Israel whom God knoweth;\n   He will raise him up over the house of Israel to correct him.\n His words shall be more refined than costly gold, the choicest;\n   In the assemblies he will judge the peoples, the tribes of the sanctified.\n His words shall be like the words of the holy ones in the midst of sanctified peoples.\n Blessed be they that shall be in those days,\n   In that they shall see the good fortune of Israel which God shall bring to pass in the gathering together of the tribes.\n May the Lord hasten His mercy upon Israel!\n   May He deliver us from the uncleanness of unholy enemies!\n The Lord Himself is our king for ever and ever.\n"

In that \nday was sent to me from Babylonie of some Prince that was \n\n[129v]\ngreater & more worll8 then all men of his tyme some Booke\nthat is said Cephar Raziel, which containeth 7 books & 7 treatises.\n\n  \n  \n\n  7. ferial: i.e. festival (Lat. feria).\n  \n\n  8.

The name of the Prince that sent it to me\nwas Sameton,9 & one of the tway [=two] wisemen that brought it to\nme was said Karmazail,10 & that other Zazont. The name of\nthis expounded in Latin is Angelus magnus secreti Creatoris.\nThat is to say the great Angell of the secret Creator. And in\nhebrew Cephar Raziel that is the booke of Sothnes & of fullfilling\n& it was the first booke after Adam written in language of Caldey [=Chaldaean]\n& afterward translated in hebrue.  And know each man that\nreadeth it, that in it is all Semiforax, that is the great name\ncompleate with all his names whole & euen & with his vertues &\nhis sacraments & I found in it 7 bookes that is 7 treatises. And\nknow yee that I found the first & the last full darke & the twey11\nmiddle more playne. And allthoug I found them darke, I\nexpounded them as much as I could & might.

Therefore Solomon bad to his \nwriter Clarifaton11 that he should write it which knew well the \nlanguage of Caldey of Inde & of Ebrew [Hebrew] & Syrike & his right explanation \nNotheles12 Salomon after that Clarifaton said corrected it & dressed13 after that \nit should be the better & ordeined it in the better manner that he might.\nClarifaton said that was the writer of Solomon that this booke is of such\ngreate vertue, priuitie & of full greate honour & it was sent to Solomon\nfor such great price & most loue. And euerych treatise of these was\nwritten by it selfe, but although it be so it ought to be one booke alone\nby it selfe, for none of those should suffise without another\nwherefore, it is necessary that they be together. wherefore Solomon\nordeyned that all were one boke as it ought to be, & as it\n\n[130r]\nought to be read & wrought & he ordeyned much better then philosophers \nhad ordeyned & he taught how a man ought to doe his worke by it. And\nhe put euerych treatise by it self, & euery chapter by it selfe, ordeyned \nall till to the end of the booke.

It is necessary\nto haue the same keyes & none other of this Castill & of his gates\n& of his Closings. Thus I say this that is for to know the starrs\n& their names & their figures & their natures. And when they should\nbe good, & when they should be evill. And this I say of the fixe25 \n& of the 7 erratic.26 neuertheles consider thou euermore the nature\nof the circle of the 12 signes that is the tuares.27 And therefore it\nbehoveth that eich man that hath this booke that he hold it cleanly\n& keepe he hit with great reuerence & with great honour. And\nwho that hath it & can read it, ne read he it not, but if he were\nbefore of full cleane of body & with great witte. And I make every\nman to know or wite that he ought not to worke by this booke in vein,\nneither without witte, neither without lawe or reason, & this is when\nevery man doth to the contrary or when any reptiles or wode beasts\nshould lett thee or do harmes to thee. And to know thou that although\nthou haue might & trust for to worke by this booke.

The first heigher\nthat is said the old, Sabaday is Saturnus the Nature of which is\ncold & dry for that it is much straite & melancholiouse & it signifieth\nfathers, & wrath & discord in lands. The second is said zedek, &\nhe is temperate for that he is betwixt the old Sabaday & the hott\nMadin, & Zadek is hott & moist sanguine in fauour sweet, &\nit draweth a good ayre & it signifieth good and honour & vertu.\n\nThe third is the fighter madyn & he is hott & dry euell &\nlesser & brenner, rauisher & lyer. The forth is haminu [or hamina] i.e. Sol, \nmiddle among other hole (?) & mighty & worll. & all the other brethren \nshameth & dreadeth him & he is much soth faste & stronngr. The \nfift is the faire Noga called cold & moist glad phlegmaticke fatt \n& flesht & well seeming in all his members & cheres & he signifieth \ngood singds (?)35 & he is much glad among women. The sixt is the writer \n& the fore speaker cocab. This holdeth him selfe withall & serueth to \nall & signifieth writers & teidyngs & voyces after that it shall be \nwith hit that with everych he holdeth himselfe when he is with \nit. The seuenth brother is Labana [Levanah] & it is Malx, & it is could [cold] \n& moyst & it signifieth brethern & itt bareth eich month the \nmaundements of brethern to brethern. After that it is seuered from \nthem.\n\n  \n  35. K: soughts.\n  \n\nDeinde Loquamus de septem fratribus quare dicuntur \nclaues &c.\n\n And then speak we of the 7 brethern why they be sayd \nthe keyes of the world, & which this world may not excuss neither \nexcuseth.  And these were formed as 4 brethern, which be said the 4 \nelements & they hau after signification wit & discretion & might \ncomplete & honest & strengt & everych may in his hemispheare yt \nis empire. As an Emperour in his empire, or as a prince in his lordship. \nAnd they hau might on the 7 parties which we seyne Climates. And \nknow thou that these bene mighty upon all beasts heere formed. And \nSalomon said prophetes clepeth these brethern 7 quicke spirits & hooly \nAnd wise men sayden that they were 7 lamps brennynge or 7 candlesticks \nof light & of life. And all prophetes clepeth 7 heauenly bodies \nwhich be 7 Planets & of cominle they be said 7 starrs. And 7 brethern \nbe kept of 4 beasts full of syen before & behynd which be the \nparties of heuen. East, West, South, North. & they hau might in \nthese foure parties of the world & in 4 times, & in 4 natures with her \ncomplexions & with all her parties & in the 4 Elements. And with this together \nledde and moued all things moueable of the commaundement of \nGod that put them in their places.\n\nDixit Salomon Sicut fuerunt semper status superius &c. \n\nSalomon \nsaid as there were euermore states aboue without corruption \nso know thou that there is now & shall be euermore. And for this \nwe understandeth the bodies aboue cleane & good & made without \n\n[132v]\ncorruption. And the nether bodies uncleane euill treated & \nbroken & eich day they falleth & ben corrupted. And this \ncorruption resteth not neither is made weary of the which \nwe understand that the nether bodies mought not excuse \nthe ouer bodies. And all things which we sene beneath him \nrote & beginnynge for things aboue. for things aboue be \nwith out life & withou dolour. And things beneath by the \ncontrarie hau death with dolour. & things aboue haue duringe \nwithout corruption. And things beneth eich day faylleth & \nbe corrupted & minished. And all prophets sayn that if these \nlacked any one of the ouer bodies that is of these that be much \naboue X. Ml 36 betwixt tho that we sene & tho that we se not. \nKnow thou that it were a greate precipitacion & destruction & \nconfusion in land & in sea & in the 4 Elements if it were \nbroken or euill treated any of the bodies above. And if there \nfailed one of the 7 brettern the Earth  should come againe \nto his first stake, when all the Elements were cintuse.37\nAnd if any of them bodylie had receiued corruption know thou \nthat it were destroyed all thing that receiueth soule or life.\nAnd know thou as the 4 Elements be turned downward they \nbe not turned without some reason of the 7 aboue. & this \nsayth the philosopher when the Sunn is destroyed eich life \n& eich soule is destroyed. And when the Moone is destroyed \nthe ligatures or bindinges of the Sea be destroyed. And \nknow thou that Saturnus is earthly & holdeth all the Earth in \na ballance that it is not moued. And Jupiter the ayre \n& Mars the fier. And Sol the day & men. And Venus the \nfayrer parties of the world. & Mercurius Reason. And \nLuna the Earth Sea & waters & their powers. And know \nthou that euerych after that is were or shall be in his exaltation \nordeyned & bounden with the sonne that reasons & words \n& speachs should be good betwixt men. And as ofte as Mercurius \nwere ioyned in Virgine in the same point with Sole direct \n& not retrograde make we sutill things & reasonable. \nAnd as oft as Sol were in Ariete so many yeares unlike he \ngeueth  unto us. And as oft as Saturne were in Libra so many \nmutations he giueth in lands. And as oft as Jupiter is ioyned \nwith Saturne in an Earthen signe so many diuerse mutations or \nchaungings he giueth & he changeth lawes & sects38 & \nLordshipps. And thus understand thou in other complexions \nof Planetts after the states of them & their beholdings that \nis said aspectus.\n\n  \n  36. K: ten thousand.\n\n  37. (?); K: confused.\n\n  38.

The right nostril\nto Mars,] Venus the \nleft, & Sol the right eye, Luna the left. Mercury the \nmouth.39 These 7 hooles thet hau in power aboue upon the \nhead of a man. And Salomon said that a man is a \nmeasure which is said Palmus made with hande in ye which \nbene all the vertues of the world, & of the 7 planets & that \nis only the head of a man. Wherefore every man is likened \n\n[133r]\nto his Starre & to his Elements. And Salomon said when I \nfound a Spirite aboue retrograde or combust, or euill treated. \nThus I say that his body was euill treated beneath in which \nit was like or he signified in hit. And who that were so wise \nthat he knew his Signe & planett & his starre aboue & \nhis sign~atoar,40 he might do good & euill to himselfe & other men \nAnd the nativities of beasts beth demed such workings \nyou shall do with the helpe of god.\n\n  \n  39.

The severall Signes also of the Zodiack take care of their members. So Aries governs the head, and face, Taurus the neck, Gemini the armes, ....\"\n\n  40. K: signification.\n  \n\nPostquam diximus de 12 figuris [*signes] & planetis &c. \n\nAfter that we \nhaue said of thhe 12 figures [*signes] & planetts & of radiis of them\nwe should say that ech Planet that were in ascendence it is nempned coniunctio. \nAnd how much the Latitude or bridth shall be lesse \nso much the coniunction is said stronger & if there is more \nlatitude the coniunction is febler & so I say to thee in the middle \nof heauen. And od the points of the 12 houses which be the \nstronger places of all houses, I say the point of the first \ndegree of the house. And eich starre that were lesse & hath \nupon himselfe another, thilke is said41 that it hath power & \ngoeth upon another \n\nfrom starr to starre & this ech starr that \ndiuerseth from another by 60 degrees before & after: it is said \naspectus sextilis, that is the sixt beholdinge. And ech planet \nthat diuerseth 90 degrees before & behind, it is said in aspectu 4to.\nthat is in the 4th beholding. And ech planet that diuerseth 120 \ndegrees before & behind it is said in aspectu tertio, that is in the \nthird beholding. And ech planet that diverseth by 180 degrees is \nin opposition in that that [sic] it is in the Contrarie place. The[se] be the 7 \nbeholdings & no mo duo tertii duo 4ti and duo sextiles, & unus \noppositus, that is to sey, tweyne42 in the third, tweyne in the fourth & \ntweyne in the sixt & one contrary as against. The coniunction \nis complete when they be in one degree. Double coniunction \nof twey good or temperate sheweth double good. As twey euill \nby the contrary sheweth much euill. Twey sextiles beholdinge the \nascendent auaileth one good of terno. And twey terni auaileth \nin beholding the ascendent, one good fortune in the ascendent. And \ntwey quarti in beholding the ascendent auayleth one greiuous or \nheavy, if there were euill sters. And twey opposita auaileth one \nin fortunate in the ascendent or in the oppo~ita. And twey quarti \nauaileth as much as a starr falling or combust or retrograde \nthat is letted in the ascendent, one fortune or tweyne in the \nascendent and another of sextili, & another of terni beholdinge \nthe ascendent sheweth much good hasty or highing. Twey evill \nin the ascendent or one with another in opposito that is in the contrary \nor of falling they shew \n\na greiuous & long impediment. And \nif they be falling & letted it shall be wors, one fortunate in \nascendent beholden of twey ternis it sheweth much good, & how \nmuch there were mo wittnesses upon the figure of which thou \nenquirest or seekest, or of which thou workest so much it shall be \nthe better. And if three planets beholding the ascendent with good \nbeholding & twey euill, the good ouer the euill & so of other. One \ninfortune & in hascendent beholden of twey quartis sheweth much \ngriefe. Caput draconis is much better then cauda. Ech Planet \nin his head of the same degree more Lordshippeth in the figure for \nthat it is twey in latitude to the weye of the Sunne & it profitteth\n\n[133v]\nin going toward the party of the north. Ech planet in the tayle \nof the dragon is ministring of his worke that goeth toward \nthe South.\n\n  \n  41. thilk is said: the same is said.\n\n  42. tweyn: twain, i.e. two. \n  \n\nLuna coniunct or ioyned with Saturnu & Marte \nin the ascendent it constrayneth & thristeth43 diuells. Saturnus \nmaketh in deuills strenght & great power. Luna coniunct \nor ioyned with Joue [Jupiter] & Venere [Venus] in ascendent it sheweth \ngreat dilection & great loue in eich good thing. Luna ioyned \nwith Martis & Saturno in th [sic] ascendent it sheweth impediment \nbut if the planet were of good receiueying. Luna \nioyned with Sole in one point [sheweth] greate grace & that if they \nwere good. Luna ioyned in falling (?) & to Mercury in the \nasce3ndent it sheweth the contrary. Luna in ascendent \nby it selfe signifieth after that the planet to which it is \nioyned. Luna with Capite Draconis in the ascendent sheweth \ngood. Luna with Cauda [Draconis] or Combust or ioyned with \n\na starre \nletted or in euill setting it sheweth much euill. When caput \nDraconis Lune were with capite Saturni, & there were \nLuna or Saturne & there is worke of celsan made it \nsignifieth upon burdinger (?) of deuills fowle & euill. Ech \nplanett that is with dracone of another & both be ioyned \nit sheweth a soth & or vemp*eprke44, & more in the ascendent. \nAnd if Caput draconis were of Jouis or Lune & these twey \nconiunct or ioyned in th ascendent it sheweth much good & \nencreasing of good & of honour. And if it were in cauda \nnot only when there were twey Cauda Draconis that is of \nLune & of other they be full euill when luna were with \nthem. When Caput draconis Lune were with capite draconis \nMartis, & Luna & mars in thilke point it sheweth strength \n& might. And if Cauda with Cauda & Luna & Mars together \nit is full greivous & euill. after yt euerych is euill after \nthe place or beholding of another. Caput draconis & Luna \nin Capite Arietis Luna Sol in Zamni sheweth great might & \ngreat honour. And by the contrary in Libra beneth with cauda \ndraconis. Caput draconis with capite veneris sheweth much \nloue & in cauda the contrary. Caput draconis mercurii \nwith capite draconis Lune sheweth worke of reason & of \nvoic & of many sownes [sounds]. And in cauda Lune with Mercury \n& Saturno it sheweth us the beholdinge of many experiments. \nLune in capite sui draconis sheweth & if there were Jupiter \nor venus it shall do the worke of Jouis or of Veneris & it shall \nprofitt in all good as these be good. Luna if it be in cauda sui \ndraconis & Mars \n\n& Saturne with hit or they beholdeth it with \neuill beholding sheweth as euill as we haue said of Saturnus & \nMarte. And we haue said that Saturne norisheth diuills & \nMars draweth & thresteth & figureth them. And Saturnus \ngathereth together many deuills; Venus & Saturnus gathereth \ntogeher diuills & winds from beneth. A good starre \nin the ascendent & luna ioyned with a good starr\n\n[134r]\nsheweth much good: and the begining in all hit in which were dn~s \nquarte that is the end Lord of the 4th And if the 4th house is well \nbeholden of good all the end of the thing (?) shall be good when the lord \nof the forth house were euill & euill treated it sheweth noyi & euill. \nA signe ascendent sheweth the body. The Lord of the Ascendent \nor the planet that is in the ascendent or which beholdeth it sheweth \nit his spirit. And the Lord of the houre signifieth his soule & his will. \nAnd thus understand thou in other domes the body & the soule & the \nspirit, ffor these 3 know thou that they make the body of a man \nsafe & hoole.\n\n  \n  43. thristeth: throws.\n\n  44.

Hermes \nsaid Saturnus is anhaunced in libra. And Jupiter in Cancro. And \nMars in Capricorno. And Sol in Ariete. And Venus in Piscibus.\nAnd Mercurius in Virgine. And Luna in Cancro. And know thou \nthat Saturnus gladeth or ioyneth in the 12 house. & Jupiter in the \n2. & Mars in his 6. & Sol in the 9. And Venus in the 5. And \nMercurius in the Ascendent. & Luna in the 3.

Salomon began & said. I put or set the first \nstone Carbuncum, 1.e. rubinum, For that it is brighter & clearer & fairer \n& of more price aboue all other stones. And I woll say of his colour & his \npower & his vertue, & of his seale & of his figure that ought to be \nin it. And thus I shall say in all other stones. Ech stone signifieth \ndurability or lastingnes without end. The colour of Rubin is as the \ncolour of fire sparckling. And his power is that he shyneth by night as \nstarr or as a flame of fire sparklinge. And the vertue of it is that it \nmaketh good colour of men that beareth it reuerently. And it encreaseth \nhis good of this world among other men. And the ymage which thou ought \nto put in hit ought to be as Draco that is a dragon well fayre with dread.\n\nThe second stone is Topazius of which of which the colour is cytrine as of gold. his \npower is that if it be put in a caudron with feruent or boyling water \nit with holdeth that it may not boyle which is for great \npower of making could. And the vertue of it is that it maketh a man \nchast that beareth it with him & it giueth benevolence or well willing \nof great Lords. And his figure is a Faucon [falcon]. \n\nThe third stone \n\n[135r]\n\nis smaragdus this stone is greene & faire upon all greenenesse, and it is \nnot heavy as other. And his power ia to keepe the light, & it healeth \nthe face. And it doth many wonderfull things. And his vertue is to encrease \nriches. And who that beareth it in gold prophecieth things to come. And \nthe figure of it is Scarabeus that is a man~ flye.\n\n The 4th stone is \nJaguncia [jacinth] the color of which is red as the graynes of an apple. Of these \nsothlie there will be well coloured some & some a little & some in the \nmiddle manner. his power is that he that beareth it is not infect with \nalien infirmity. his vertue is that he giueth health & honour, & keepeth \nthe man bearing it hoole in ways or in Journeys. And his figure is a \nLion well figured.\n\n The 5 stone Crisopazius of which the colour is \ngreene & within it hath similitude as though it had golden dropps. And \nhis power is to defende a man from the podagrie. And his vertue is that it \nmaketh to prophecy things to come if it were in the hand cleane & chast. And \nhis figure is the Image of an Asse.\n\n The 6 stone is Saphirus the colour of \nwhich is full ledy & faire as the colour of the pure cleane heauen. \nhis power is that he healeth all infirmities that wexeth in a man of \ninflamacion & greuance of the eyes. And it cleanseth them much. And if \nin this stone be grauen the head of a man with the beard it delivereth \na man from prison & from all pressure. And this stone accordeth to the power \nof great Lords & of kings. If this stone be kept cleanly, reuerently & chastly \n& that it be good oriental with it a man might attayne great honour & \nthe profitt of it that he seeketh & coueteth. And sem~en putteth there the \nsigne of a wether z. Arietis.45\n\n  \n  45. K: the signe of a ram. Aries.\n\n  \n\nThe 7 stone is Berillus the colour of wch \nis of the eye or of sea water & some of them be round & some of 5 \ncorners. This stone ought to be cleare wthin & cleane and his power is to \nchauf the hand closed of him that beareth it. And if it be set in gold it \ngiueth great freindshipe betwixt twey men if thou touchest them \nwith it. And his figure is Rana, that is a frogge & it is of great \npower for to make peace concord & loue. \n\nThe 8 stone is Onix [onyx]. this \nstone is full blacke, & his power is to giue him that beareth it many \ndreadfull dreames & dreades. he that beholdeth himselfe in it hath \npower upon all deuills in constrayneing them & in cleping & in \ngatheringe them together in speculeo tabileo [jubileo?] coniuring as it behoueth. \nAnd his figure is the head of a camell or twey heads betwixt twey trees \nthat be said mirti. \n\nthe ninth stone is said Sardus the colour of which \nis red & faire, & his power is to make other stones fairer. his vertue is to \ngiue good colour to him that beareth it, and it is put in gold. And if \nthere be grauen in it Aquila that is an Egle [eagle] it giueth great honor. \n\nthe \ntenth stone is Crisolitus and it is of golden colour & sparkling as \nfire. his power is to gather together deuills & winds. And his vertue \nis to defend the place where it is from euill spiritts & dead men that they do \nnot there any euill. And that deuills obey to thee. And his figure is \nvulture that is a vowter.\n\nThe 11 stone is said Cliotopia. And it is a \nstone of great power of which the colour is greene & faire & shineing \n& cleare with dropps like blood well red within. This stone is said the \nstone of wise men, of prophetes & of Philosophers. And this is honoured for twey \nthings for the colour like to Smaragdo in greenesse, and in rednesse \nto Rubino. The price of this stone ouercometh the price of other, and of his \nvertues & proprieties. the power of this stone is that if it be put in any \nbroad vessell full of water to the sunne it resolueth the water into vapour. \nAnd it maketh it to be raised upward till that into the forme of Rayn [rain] \nit be conuerted downeward. His vertue is that who that beareth it in the \nmouth or in the hand closed he may not be seene of any man. With this \nstone a man may haue power upon all deuills & make eich \nincantacion or enhantment [enchantment] that he woll. And in this stone ought \nto be grauen vespertino. thus he saith but I trowe it be vespertilio\n\n[135v]\n\nthat is a backe46, or reremouse.47 \n\n  \n\n  46. backe: bat (Lat. vespertilio).\n  \n\n  47. Dormouse.\n\n  \n\nthe 12 stone is Cristallus \nof which the colour is of water congeled of cold. his power is \nthat he putteth asbtray of fire from him. And his vertue is that \nhe encreaseth to norich [nourish] much mylke [milk] and good. And thou may \ntake in it what vertue thou wilte. After that the houre shall \nbe in which thou hast wrought. And after that the ymage \nshall be which thou hast made although they be many, & hit \nbe seene easy. know thou that it hath many vertues. And his \nfigure is a Griffon that is a fowle & a beast, for he hath \n4 feete & 2 wings, & he is a great beast. \n\nthe 13 stone \nis Cornelnia and it is likned to water in which bloode as \nthe loture [i.e. lotion] or washing of blood. And his power is to stanche \nblood of the nostrills. And of these be grauen in hit a man well \nclothed holding a yarde48 in hande, it giueth honour to him yt \nbeareth it. \n\nthe 14 stone is Jaspis & it is thicke derke greene \n& red, & there be some greene & cleare & they be better \nthen other. And there be some red thicke & dropped. And his \npower is that who yt beareth it, is not \n\nletted with venyme neither \nwith serpent neither with Attercoppe [i.e. spider], neither with scorpion, & it \ndefendeth a man from a feauer if in it be grauen Leo, Aries, or \nSagittarius.\n\nthe 15 stone is yris [=iridescent quartz] & it is likened to Cristall or \nto gellij [jelly]1 & it hath corners, & if any man put it in an house \nto the beame of the sunne, so that the beames passe through it \nor by it, the colour appeareth of the Rayne bow [=rainbow]. And for this \ncause it is sayd yris that is the Rainbow.

And his Image \nis a man that holdeth his right hand straight forth to heauen. \n\nThe 21 stone is Cerannus. This stone is of diuers colours after \ndiuers climates & diuers lands. Otherwhile white, otherwhile \nbrowne & greene & red. And els where it is likened to yron [iron] \n& somewhere to copper & to sulphure & it hath as roundletts \n\npainted & little drops. And his power is to defende a place from \nthundrings & lightnigs. And his vertue is to defende from all \nenemies. And write thou in hit in one partie Raphael, Michael, \nGabriel. And on that other side Pantaseron, Micracon. Saidalson. \nAnd thou berest & hast it in thy power thou shalt ouercom all \nenemyes & thine aduersaries. \n\nthe 22 stone is Ametistus & \nit hath the colour of wine upon a white cloath or of rose, or \nviolett. And this hath might to chase away fendes. And his \nvertue is to defend from drunkennesse. And his figure is Vrsus \nthat is a beare. \n\nthe 23 stone is magnetis or magnes. And it is of \ngreat weight & like to ferro brunito. his power is that he \ndraweth dead yron [iron] as nayles, knife & sword. And his vertue is \nthat with it thou might be in what house thou wilt & doe \nwhat thou wilt with men & with things of the house suffuming \nthe house of hit & with this men made enchantments. And \ngraue thou in it a man 7, armed when Luna were in Ariete \nor Scorpione ioyned with Marte. And Sol (?) be it beholding them of \nterno aspectu. And know thou that what manner images thou \ngrauest in this stone such enchantments thou might attayne and \nbeare with thee & thou shalt profitte. \n\nThe 24 stone is Adamas \n& it is of middle colour & the better hath somewhat of greennesse. \nAnd his power is that with it other stones be grauen, & therefore we \nhaue put it more straunge, and more utter.49 And his power or vertue \nis to keepe the members of a man safe & hole. And this stone is \nmore &\n\nbetter it selfe at price in enchauntmenmts and in inuocations \nof winds, spirits & deuills. And with this thou may send whateuer \nfantasy thou wilt.

And these experiments were now written in party \nin Raziele, although Salomon put to of this there, & of the \nSaiues of Hermetis. And the herbs be put in the booke of Razielis \nfor that with them we may be excused & worke with \nherbs as with Sem~ with fasting & words in good & euill. \nAnd [let] no man Joyne himself to Semiforas till he know \nhimself in the first wing & in the second. And thus we \nshall say all thing that shall be to us necessary with \nthe help of god.\n\nDe tertia Ala. [The third wing.]\n\nDixit Salomon super Alam tertiam sicut Corpus Solis &c. Salomon \nsaid upon the third wing as the body of the Sunne is more \nappearing & mighty upon all other bodies & brighter, \n& fairer & clearer. So the vertues of sensible beasts wch \nfeeleth [K: flyeth] and sendeth out \n\nvoice, & seeth. And so beasts of the \nthird wing haue power upon the twey first wings of stones & \nof herbs & he put therefore in this Raziel 24 beasts with their \nnames, & vertues & states. And the figures be 24 distincte & \ndeparted a twyne. And I will put upon eich element 6 \nbeasts euerich distinct from other & euerich of his kynde. And as the \nfier is the high lord & distinct from the 4 Elements. And the \nlife of them all is purer and cleaner among them, therefore I \nbeginne to say upon the beasts of fire, for as eich of the \n4 Elements hath his beast beneath, so the fire hath his aboue \npure & cleane without corruption. And this fier that is aboue \nis not expounded of wexe & trees neither oyle, neither with \nother composition, but it is simple. And the things that liueth in it \nbe the angels cleare & clean & bright like to the beames \nof the Sunne & like to the flame of the fire, or of a sparck \nof fire, or of a starre or of the Colour of Quickesiluer or of \npure gold. And this similitude is naturall in the beasts of \nthe fire, & the figures of them bene seeme such as the \nlighteninge in similitude & in deed. For as an Orison is a \nMessager to the Creator, so they be ready anon to good & \neuill & they seyn like things of prophetes that upon the \n4 Elements be heauens with their beasts of which wee \nshould say furthermore.\n\nThe second spirit is much cleane, but \nderker then the ou~ & it is likened to the winde. And his figure \nafter that he will take & after some of the 4  Elements to which \nhe is ioyned, & he formeth himselfe in this manner either by water or \nby a cloude or by moystnes or by thicknes of some darkenes or he \nreceaueth some body as fume of some kynde by falling in it either \nby vois or by sleep [K: shape] of a beast elemented by these he taketh \nforme after that the nature aboue disposeth. \n\nThe third \nbeast of which wisemen seyne is that euermore he fellowshippeth \n\n[139r]\nspirit & most the corpulent & thicke of the spirit. And therefore his figure is \nfound by night in places of drede & it is heard & seene & that ofte tyme. \nAnd the Colour of it is like to tp~i z after the nature of houre, ere it is \nmade, otherwhile to the similitude of the body of which it went out. \nWherefore sommen seeth otherwhile the soules of bodies in church yards \nhayes. And of these souls said the wise Hermes & the prophet that the \nsoule that goeth out & hath might is not neither was but a man or \nwoman, & upon such manner soules speaketh wisemen & clepest \nthem spirituall & heauenly, spirituall for goodnes, heauenly for simplenes. \n\nThe fourth beast is the winde. Eich day we hearen but we seen not \nalthough we seen other, & hearen not. And the works of the winde be seene \nto the eye after the party from which it cometh. And he hath such nature \nthat if he is orientall or meridionall, that is East or South, he is hote. \nAnd if he is occidentall or septentrionall that is West or north he is cold. \nThis we seene to haue greate power for it beareth clouds & waters, & \ntempests & haules [K: gayles]. And it stirreth the Sea, & troubleth the Sea & breaketh \ntrees, & this is said quicke ayer, as the fire aboue is said quicke fire & simple. \nAnd therefore the Elements be said double or twey fold, that is to say fixe \n&  moveable. Moueable it is that it dwelleth in the corners of the Earth \nalthoug it descend from aboue. ffor the 7 aboue bindeth & looseth it for of \nthem it descendeth & it was formed of them & this is a great saeg' [? K: figure] in \nsea, in ayre, & in land as it cometh temperate. \n\nThe 5 beast or vision \nis a fantasie that is a shade to the similitude of diuers colours or manners \ncompownd of diuerse together. And this forme is made in desert place \nor in a corrupt ayre. Or other while it descendeth from hills to the \nsimilitude or likenes of knights & they be sayd Exercitus antiquus that \nis an olde ofte [*host or army]. And otherwhile upon waters to the similitude of faire \nwomen & well clothed, or in meades, & some sayne that they be faces. \nAnd otherwhile this befalleth in a man of corruption or malice of \ncomplexions & of humours that be in a man, & they be said \ndemonaici for that it ascendeth the head & falleth upon the eyne, & \nsuch corruption maketh to see many fantasies. \n\nThe 6 beast is \nsaid Demon. This descendeth in highnes to lownes & he was formed \nof pure matter without corruption. Wherefore he faileth not but shall \neuermore endure although he haue taken thicknes in darknes of the \nlownesse of the Earth & he is pure in matter and strong in body. And \nof this saith the wiseman that he knoweth all things that is. And \nby him Philosophers haue answeres & wisemen of all things, of which \nthey will know the sothnes. And he dwelleth euermore in darkenesse \n& in obscurity & he is neuer seuered from them. And of this sayth \nthe Prophet that he hath power of takeing forme or shape wch \nhe woll in the Earth after the will of the Creator. And he is said \na bright angell mighty & faire as the forme of the sonne & of the \nmoone & of a starre or of an angell or of a cloud or of a fowle \nor of a fish or of a man, or of a beast or of a reptile that is a \ncreepeing beast or any other forme which he wold. And all these \naboue said without them know thou that they be impalpable, \nor unable to be feled that is that they may not be taken with hand \nneither be touched with fote for they be spiritts or windes. \n\n[139v]\nAnd know thou that euerich of the abouesaid when it befalleth in any \nof the Elements he taketh a body of them although the life of them \nbe of the fire & the dwelling of them be in the fire & their deeds \nfuyry, for they be fuyry. And Raziel said upon these 6 that invocation \nof them & appearing & constrayning & binding & loosing also \nto do good or euill by them, All is made with cleanesse [therefore] who that \nwould clepe them or haue the seruice of them & with Orison and \nfasting & fumigation, & with praysing of god as thou shalt here \nfurthermore.\n\nAnimalia æris tertiæ alæ vocantur aues &c. Beasts of the ayre \nof the third wing be cleped souls, for that they flyeth & they be of \n4 menynge. One is said runnyng. Another flying, & swimminge & \ngoing or creeping. Now say we of flying. And begynne we \nfirst of Aquila that is an Egle [eagle], for that he is a fowle flyinge \nmuch in height. And he hath Lordship upon all other fowles. \nThe Eagle hath such a nature that he taketh his sonns or birds \nwhen they be little. And ascendeth them into a place when \nthe Sunne is high. And then he drepeth the face of them to the \nSunne & if they behold strongly the Sunn he deemeth them to be \nhis sons & good. And if they behold not, he deemeth to be \nnot his and euill & letteth them fall & dye. And a feather \nof him freteth another fether. And he seeth farre by one \nleague or mile a little beast. A great beast sothly he seeth by \n9 leagues or by a days Journey. The eye of him with the heart \nhaue great vertue & grace to a lord king or to a lord of a land, \nfor that giueth to him grace in his reame.\n\nThe second fowle is \nsaid Vultur that is a Vowter [vulture]. This hath great vertue in all his \nmembers. The head of him helpeth against all dreames & against \ncraft of Magicke. And the feete helpe against malefetes. \nAnd if an house be suffumed with 9 fethers of him it putteth out \nfrom it euill spiritts. The gall of him helpeth the eyne better \nthen any thing of the world. Th' eyen of him put in the skinne \nof a serpent, & the tong of him in a cloth of silke red \nwlapped [sic wrapped] with them, helpeth in causes in which thou couitest to \nouercome & for to wynne the loue of another lord. The wings \nof him put upon a bed defendeth a man sleeping from euill winds \n& from all greevance & from euill spiritts, neither may they may \nlett in all the house, neither any fantasies haue power nether other \nthings.\n\nThe third fowle is Falco, that is a Falcon of whom \nthe vertue is that of great Lords he is sett att much price. \n\nThe boon of the highnes of the right wing ouercometh plees \nboth in rauishing and in takeing away alien thing. and the \nheighnes of the left wing taketh away euill feuers. But \nwe ought not to slea venatiue foules neither \n\n[140r]\nhounds although they haue many vertues in themselues. And know thou \nthat how many members be in euery beast, foule, fish or reptile, so \nmany vertues distincte hath euery member by himself.\n\nThe 4 foule is \na turtur1 simple & good. netheles if thou takest the male & the \nfemale together in a new potte with croco & provinca & cicorea \ngathered together upon them which thou wolt ioyne together if \nthou casteth the pouder of these upon them know thou that \nanon they shall be ioyned together. And it giueth great loue [love] to him \nthat beareth the pouders with them.\n\n  \n  1. Turtur: turtledove.\n  \n\nThe 5 foule is said Vpupa, that \nis a lapwing haueing a creast of fethers in the head as a cocke. \nAnd he hath many vertues. This hath one boon in his wings & it \ngathereth together deuills & spiritts of the ayer. The property of him is \nthat who euer taketh the hearte of him & wlappeth [wrappeth] it in hony, \nAnd then assoone as he may swallow it, & drinketh the milke \nof a white or red or a black cowe, know thou that it maketh \na man to say things to come. And he hath another vertue for who yt \ncutteth of the necke where a cocke croweth not neither may be \nheard, neither the voice of an hound, neither [where] wheate is sowen \nthere & when he cutteth of his necke inclepe the deuills & then \nbear he with him the halfen deale of the blood. And of that other \nhalfen deale anoynt he himselfe, euermore shall go with  him one \nof the deuills that is to witte, he whom he can inclepe which shall \nsay many things to him.\n\nThe 6 foule is said Ciconia1 that is an \nhaysoule, who that sleath him in the day of Lune & taketh the blood \nof the heart of him & anoynteth himself with it & eateth the flesh \nwith se~re feni~l & with cardamomo & gariofilo, & ere he eate it suffume \nhe himself with good odours as with thure mastic & cinamom & other such \nknow thou yt he shall haue grace of enchanting which he wolle & of \nconiuring & constrayning the spiritts of the ayer & other spiritts that goe \nupon riuers & wells.\n\n  \n  1. Crane or stork.\n  \n\nThese 6 foules abouesaid be an ensample upon \nall other. And when thou wilt know the vertue of any foule, do \nthou after the precept of this booke, Raziel, upon the booke of visions \nof Angells upon the begininge of tymes in the 12 months as thou shalt \nsee furthermore.\n\nDicamus de piscibus marinus & aliis &c. Say we of fishes of the sea & \nother upon vi of them that is to witt of the more & middle that I  should shew the vertues of them.\n\nThe first fish is Balena [whale], the fattnes \nof which made liquid kept 7 yeares or more, for how much it is elder \nso much it is better. It healeth a man from eich gout & euill wind if \nhe anoynt himself with it, if he anoynt the head with the blood of \nhim it helpeth him much & yeeldeth him strong & more hoole. And \nit maketh to see verrt visions. The sperma of him is said Ambra. \nIf thou suffumest tombes with this it gathereth the spiritts aboue \ndownward. And of eich petition or axinge it maketh to giue answer. \nAnd Hermes said there is not such suffumigacions for to inclepe Spirits \nas Ambra & lignum aloes, costus, mustus, crocus & bloud of a lapwinge \nwith thimiamate.1\nThese be meate & drinke & gladnes of spirits \nof the ayre. And these gathereth them together strongly & \nfull sone. And wise men say that the sperme & blood \n\n[140v]\n& the heart of a baleyne be principalls for to command the winds & \nspiritts who that maketh fumigations of them.\n\n  \n\n  1. Agrippa quotes this in OP1.43.\n  \n\nThe second fish is \nsaid Delphin [dolphin]. And he is the knight of the sea. And as the Eagle hath \nmight among foules, & the lion among beast in this manner \nhath the delphin in the Sea. Who that annoynteth of the bloode of \nhim, the cloathes of twey freinds it maketh them enemyes or \ncasteth the dry blood upon them. And who that beareth the heart \nof him maketh him hardy.\n\nThe third fish is Cancer. this hath \n6 feet, take & brenne him in panno livido & with the powders frote \nthe teeth sofhlie it healeth them & yeeldeth them faire & cureth \nthe Cancre in the mouth, if thou casteth it upon the fire wth \nsomewhat of Stercosis humani combusti it gathereth together \nspirits.\n\nThe 4 fish is bright as an horne betwixt palenesse \n& whitenesse z piscis claudims or Cepia. This fish hath many properties, \n& this enchanters & prophetts knoweth well which made with \nthis their enchantments & their transfigurations. So that when \nthey would that an house should seeme full of water, or that \na riuer should enter by the gate, they tooke  this fish & with thimiamati \n& ligno aloes & rosis & they fumiden an house & \nthey cast there of the water of the Sea. And it seemed that \nthe house were filled with water, & if he cast their blood it \nseemed bloud, & so if he cast Snow. And when they would that \nthe earth should seme to quake then they cast there of the Earth of \na plow. And they made there diuerse similitudes in all things \nafter the thing which they put in the fumigation. And know \nthou that it dureth so much as the fumigacion in the house, & \nwith the gall of him also they made many enchantments, for that this \nbeast is much unlike to other.\n\nThe 5 fish is Murena [eel], & he is \nlentiguromus (?) \nthe vertue of this is that enchanters beareth the \npowder of him with them for to make enchantments.\n\nThe 6 fish \nis rana viridis, & if thou take it upon what woman thou wilt \nand namest the names of the angels of the month in which thou \nwere [K adds: borne as I thinke] which be furthermore within in libro visionum you might \ndo good & euill of what woman you wilt.\n\nAnd know thou yt \nif these fishes & all other thou may know the vertues & properties \nall by the booke of visuions of moneths. And so understand \nyou by like thing in all other things.\n\nPrimum animal est Leo. Ista bestia est valde fortis &\nThe first beast is a Lyon [lion]. This beast is full strong in the \nbreast & in the cheekes & he is of strong beholding  or lookeing \nso that when other beasts seeth him they be moued togither with \ndread. And the skyne of him is of such vertue that if it be \nput with other skynes it destroyeth them & maketh [them] bare. & \nwho that taketh the biting toothe of him that is cleped \ndens caninus & putteth it in gold it is good to take away & \nto take alien things. And the same doth a woolues \n\n[141r]\ntooth. & if thou maketh a purse of the heart of a lion full of \nblood musco & almea, & ligno aloes & thimiamate, & it were \ngadered upon whom thou wilt & thou maketh hote, know thou that in \nthat houre he shall love thee much & doe thy bidding. And if thou \ninclepest with the blood of a goat the prince of deuills he shall be \nready anon to do thy maundement. And so more kinga or he for whom \nthou dost. And the same I say of great women.\n\nThe second beast is Elephans that is an Elephant & he is full great & when \nhe is risen of herd he lieth, & when he falleth of herd he riseth \nfor that therto he hath not knees disposed well. And the boone of \nthe teeth of him is said Ebur that is Evory [ivory]. And if it be put in \nlectuaries it comforteth the feeblenes of the heart as much as \nmargarita or more. And the bloud of him with the liver \ncomforteth much fasting.\n\nThe third beast is Ceruus that is an \nheart [hart] which liueth much, for that he reneweth as the moone or \nan Egle. Who that maketh suffumigacion of the hornes is chaseth \naway serpents, & by it self it chaseth away deuills.\n\nThe 4 beast is \nCatus, that is a Catt, & he seeth better by night then by day, & \nwho that taketh of him & of an yrchin & of a reremouse & \nmaketh of alcofol & alcofolizeth his eyne he seeth well \nby night & by day. And if thou puttest <--25v--> there the eyne of an asse thou \nmight see whether the spiritts & deuills of the ayre go in.\n\nThe 5 beast is mustela, that is a wesill, this bringeth forth her \nissue at her moneth after Poets not after Philosophers. This helpeth \nmuch when he is brent, & the skinne of him is written for to cause \nloue betwixt tweyne.\n\nThe 6 beast is Talpa1 that is a wandwarp \n& dwelleth under the Earth & is likened to a mouse, with this \nbeast thou may make to come tempests, pestilences, haules, & \nlightnings & comstacions & many euill things, if thou puttest \nhim bare & naked upon the Earth & ouerturned, \nAnd with this thou may make discord & concord whom thou wilt, \nfor he is a cursed beast for that he healeth a man of \nthe fester when he is brent [burnt] & the powder ia incast.\n\n  \n  1. Mole.\n  \n\nAnd when \nthou wilt know the vertue of other beasts, do as it is said in libro visionum, \nupon which aske thou this of the lord of vision that is \nyt it appeare to the that thou askest, & couetest to know of a beast \nwhich thou wilt. \n\nThis beast seeth not neither hath eyn. And know \nthou that the vision of months is upon all things that thou askest or \nwould knowe. And God shallbe wth thee if of right thou axe. And \nknow thou that heere is fulfilled the third wing. And now beginn \nwe the fourth which is complement & fullfilling upon all the \nElements.\n\n[De quarta ala. The fourth wing.]\n\nDixit Salomon sicut corpus vivum &c. Salomon said as a quicke \nbody middle or great is  not moued with three feete neither \nany foule lesse then with 2 wings, neither the world \n\n[141v]\nis gouerned lesse then with 4 elements. So this booke may not neither ought to \nbe lesse then with 4 wings which be said 4 vertues. Wherefore Raziel \nsaid that who that shall be filled with this booke shall be as one of the \nprophets & he shall understand all vertues of things & powers of them. \nAnd if he understandeth well he shall be a quicke spirit & if he with holdeth (?) \n& worketh he shall be as an Angell. And therefore he put in this book \n22 Elements of great vertue that is 22 letters or figures which the sons of Adae \nthat is of Adam mought not excuse.\n\n1. The first is Aleph א, that is A. \nThis letter is three cornered & it signifieth life power & highnes & the principle \nor beginninge in all things. These putteth all things in their figures \n& in their principles.\n\n2. The 2 is said beth ב, that is B, & it is full good \nin things which we desire in battayle & in plee, & euermore \nsheweth goodnes & profitt.\n\n3. The third is said gimel ג, that is g. And it \nsheweth euill & greif & impediment in things.\n\n4. The 4th is said deleth ד, \nthat is d. this sheweth turbation & death of some man & harme to him.\n\n5. The 5 is said he ה, that is h, & it sheweth \nprice & honour & gladnes \n& it is full good in all thing.\n\n6. The 6 is said vau ו, that is v, & it sheweth \ndeath, paine, & trauaile.\n\n7. The 7 is said Zain ז, that is Z, & it sheweth \npenys & riches.\n\n8. The 8 is said heth ח, that is h, & it signifieth \nlong life & health. \n\n9. The 9 is said thes [Teth] ט that is t, & it \nsignifieth wrath woodnes & greif.\n\n10. The 10 is said Joth [Yod] י, that is \ni, & it signifieth good life & gladnes & all good beginninge.\n\n11. The 11 is said Caph כ, it sheweth in very gladnes & \ntrauaile without profit.\n\n12. The 12 is said Lameth ל \n& it sheweth gladnes & honour & profit.\n\n13. The 13 is said mem מ, that is m, & it sheweth greife & \notherwhile dolor.\n\n14. The 14 is said num [Nun] נ, that is n. \nIt signifieth restoring of a freind & a visitation of him & profitt.\n\n[15. The 15 is said Samech ס...]1\n\n  \n  1. Omitted.\n  \n\n16. The 16 is said ayn ע. \nIt sheweth occasion or euill of a woman.\n\n17. The 17 is said pe פ. It sheweth health.\n\n18. The 18 is said fee פ that is f. & it sheweth bloud \nyshed [is shed] of good men & high.\n\n19. The 19 is said Saday צ. It sheweth health. \n\n20. The 20 is said Coph ק It sheweth hid life.\n\n21. The 21 is said Res ר, that is r \n& it sheweth a man that is fallen & is risen.\n\n22. The 22 is said Thau ת, that is \nc. it sheweth greife & diminution.1\n\n  \n  1. Note there are two forms of Pe, and the Shin is missing.\n  \n\nNow we haue said of the 4 wings \nupon the 22 letters that be upon the lawes of the table written. \nAnd know thou that there be no moe but onely 22 letters which \nbe the roote of Sem~ [Semiforas], for with them it is formed & it is caused & is \nmade & with out them it may not be.  And some men seyne that \nCamalio found them, but it is not soth, but the Angell Raziell \ngaue them written to Adam in his booke that is said liber ignis. And \nwith them all the booke of Sem~ written. And know eich man that \nreadeth this booke that the Creator said to Raziel the names of Sem~ \nwherefore if thou canst transpose these 22 letters or figures as it \nbeseemeth thou shalt attayne the great name of the Creator. And \nwith it thou might do what thou wilt euermore with cleanes & \nwith helpe of the Creator. Now we haue fulfilled this booke \nof the wing like to the angells that is Panthaseron Micracon Sandalon, \nfor euerych of these hath 4 wings by mandement of the \nbenigne angell, which the Creator sent to me that this book \nwere better compounded & well ordeyned.\n\nHeere endeth the second booke & beginneth the \niii book of Thymiamatibus.\n\n[142r]\n\nLiber tertius.\n\n  \n\n  Cp. VRL 1300 37r; Halle 14-B-36 22v.\n  \n\nDixit Angelus adæ fac thymiamata &c. The Angell said \nto Adam make thymiamata. Thimiamata be confections of good odours \nwth which thou shalt suffume & thou shalt please to Creacion & \nthou shalt attayne to what thou wilt by this. And they of which they be made \nbe preciouse things which thou shalt find out of good odour & of good nature \n& of cleane things. And when thou shalt do it be thou cleane of without \nall filth. And then the Angell rested in that houre. And Adam remayned & \ndid that he might. And this Salomon expounded & said, I marvaile \nwhy this is the booke  of Moysy, also for the Creator said to Moysy \nmake thou Thymiamata & suffume thou in the hille1 when thou \nwilt speake with me. Wherefore Salomon said, that suffumigacions & \nsacrifice, & unction maketh to be opened the gates of the ayre & of \nthe fire & the gates of all other heauens. And by suffumigacions \na man may see heauenly things & priuities of the Creator. And \neich man know that they thirleth [drill] the Earth, water, & the lownesses. \nAnd Salomon said as there be 7 heauens, & 7 starres, & 7 dayes in the \nweeke, of which euerich is distinct & is not likened to his euen. So \nknow thou eich man that there be 7 suffumigations which wthholdeth wth \nthem the vertue of the 7 starrs, & maketh apaid [K: glad] the spirits of the ayre \nAnd the Angells of heauens & deuills, of angells of the world. And \ntherefore for a man yeldeth to them it that is theirs. Therefore they \nbe pleased & apaide for the words which thou sayst, when thou prayest \nor sayst the names of them or the names of the Creator. And for this \nthat thou dost when thou washest thee & for the gift that thou \ngiuest to them when thou suffumest. And these things yeldeth them \nearthly & appearing to thee. And the spirituall & invisible that is \nthat neither euill men, neither beasts mought see thee if thou dost \nstrongly about thee & about whom thou dost.\n\n  \n\n  1. The hill: Mt. Sinai.\n  \n\nThymiamata is made of \nmany things & these be principall upon the 7 dayes of the weeke. And \nfirst say we [of] thymiamata of the Saturday for the starre of him is higher \n& the Angell of him is mighty in the Earth. \n\nThe first Thymiama [sic]\nof the Saturday ought to be of all good things & well smelling rootes as \nis Costus & herba thuris [=hog's fennel]. And that is Thymiama of good. And so I shall \nshew of all other as it beseemeth to good. And thymiama to other I shall \nsay in an other place.\n\nThymiama of the Sunday is thure, mastix, muscus \n& other such. And all other good gummes & of good odor in all good. And by \nthe contrary in euill.\n\nThymiama of the Munday is folium mirti, & \nlauri & leaues of good odor, & so understand thou in his contrary.\n\nThymiama of the Tuesday is Sandalus rubeus, niger & albus, & all such \ntrees & eich tree of aloes & cipresse, & so understand thou of eich tree.\n\nThymiama of the Wednesday is made of all ryndes [*woods] as Cinamomo, cassia lignea \n& cortices [citri et] lauri & macis & so understand thou in other.\n\nThymiama of the \nThursday is nux muscata, [ut] gariofili & citruli & the rynd of arangiarum \nsiccarx & pulverizatarum that is the rynde of orenges dry &d pouderd & all \nother fruits of good odors.\n\nThymiamana [sic] of the Friday is maus [*flores] rosa viole \n& crocus and all other flowers of good odor.2\n\n  \n\n  2. OP1.44: To Saturn are appropriated for fumes all odoriferous roots, \n  as costus root, etc. and hog's fennel; to Jupiter, odoriferous fruits as \n  nutmeg, cloves; to Mars all odoriferous wood as sandalwood, cypress, lignum-balsam, \n  and lignum-aloes; to the Sun, all gums, as frankincense, mastic, benjamin, storax, labdanum [i.e. Cistus], \n  amber [i.e. ambergris], and Musk; to Venus, flowers as roses, violets, saffron, and such like; \n  to Mercury all peels of wood and fruit, as cinnamon, lignum cassia, mace, citron peel [i.e. lemon peel], \n  and bayberries, and whatsoever seeds are odoriferous; to the Moon the leaves of all vegetables, \n  as the leaf indum, the leaves of the myrtle, and bay-tree.\n  \n\nAnd in the contrary to the \ncontrary put you all thymiamata stincking. And know thou that eich \nthymiama of good odor gathereth together his spirits after that is his nature \n& his colour & his strength. Thus I say for good, good, for better, better.\n\nAnd Hermes said of thymiamatibus that thymiama Lune is cinamonum \n& lignum aloes & mastix & crocus & costus & macis & et mirtus. Wee \nputteth this that eich of the Planetts haue a part in it & all this may be \nLuna, good & well fortunate by good spices & sharpe.3\n\n  \n\n  3. OP1.44: But Hermes describes the most powerful fume to be, viz. that which is \n  compounded of the seven aromatics, according to the powers of the seven planets, \n  for it receives from Saturn, pepperwort; from Jupiter, nutmeg; from Mars, lignum-aloes; \n  from the Sun, mastic; from Venus, saffron; from Mercury, cinnamon; and from the Moon, the myrtle. \n  \n\n[142v]\n\nAlthough Salomon made distinction upon the days & planets of the \nspices with the which a man ought to make thymiamata. And he \nsaid that of Saturni is eich good roote in good, euill in euill. And of \nJouis all fruite, & of Martis eich tree, & of Solis eich gumme. \n& of Veneris eich flower. And of Mercurii each rinde, & of Lune \neich leafe. And thus understand you in all other. & eich odorifr \nherbe is of Veneris. And Raziel bade to Adam that he should \nmake good thymiamata & therefore Hermes understood that \neich thymiama is made of all good things, As of roote, tree, rinde, \nleafe, flower, fruite & gumm. And yett seeds be put in it, as \nbacre & cardamonum & wexe & put thou in it all good thing \n& preciouse. And sythen he said Thymiama completum.\n\nAnd the 24 (?) \nis some thymiama grecum or of greekes by which heathen men were \nwont to suffume idols & yet to day churches & aulers [K: altars] be \nsuffumed, And it is said Thymiama Jouis & in sothnes who that \nuseth these thymiamatibus be he cleane & chast & of all good \nwill to the Creator he shall profitt.\n\nDixit Salomon super \nsuffumigia hermetis quod dur &c. Salomon said upon the \nsuffumigations of Hermetis which be said beneth & they be \n7 manners with which be made sacrifices. Some be made & \nthe first which giueth fastesth & giueth teithings to the \nCreator, & therefore they trust that they attayne that they \ndesire & it is sothe.\n\nThe second is that they washen themself \n& clenseth & dwelleth cleane. And therefore they trow to attayn \ntheir petition & asking & it is sothe.\n\nThe 3 is that they do \nalmes for god & for the holy angells of him.\n\nThe 4 is that they \nsleeth & casteth the blood in the fire.\n\nThe 5 is that they \nsleeth & brenneth all.\n\nThe 6 is that they pray much in houers \nordayned 7 tymes in the day, & 3 in the night.\n\nThe 7 is to make \nfumigation with good things & well smellinge & euerych of \nthese did this that he might attayne the sothnes of it that \nhe axed & [so] he attayned it by the mandement of the Creator.\n\nAnd know thou that fumigacion ouercometh in all. Sothely who that \nsuffumeth better to the eye it proneth [? K: proveth] & with this the wise man \nexcuseth all other. And wite thou that who that can well know \nthe natures of fumigacions he migh neigh to thilke spirits wch he \nwould inclepe after the nature of fumigacions. And euermore \nconsider thou the nature of the spirit & of the fumigacion & the \nspirits be constrayned by their contrary & be comforted by  like \nthings. Wherefore it is to witt that as a wise leche in giueing a \nmedicine to a sick man remoueth the sickenes & in ledeth \nhealth. So fumigacion remoueth the contrary from the place if it be \ngood. And with euill fumigacion be remoued good spirits & euill spirits \nalso dreadeth for eich thing more loueth health then sicknes. \nAnd therefore it is said that Sulphur remoueth both good spirits \n& euill. And this is probation & pref [profit] after one way. And there [is] \nanother way for lignum aloes gathereth together the spirits of \nligni aloes & none other. And Sulphur chaseth them \n\n[143r]\naway & this is very reason. And then I say that Sulphur gathereth \ntogether his proper spirits & none other & they be full stronge & \npenetrate & thicke & be not seuerd or departed so soone from \na place. But and if a place were suffumed with Sulphur & then \nwere washen with water & suffumed wth ligno aloes, it doth \ndraw away the spirits of Sulphur & induceth or inledeth his \nowne.\n\nAnd know thou that the spirit of Azet that is quickesilver \n& the spirit of Thuris be contrary although spirits yet with all \nthe deuills entreth & thirleth rather then the spirit of Thuris \nwherefore euerich hath full great might. And if thou wilt \nout draw the spirits, yet suffume thou with thur & they shall \ngo out. And so understand thou of all other spirits good & euill.\n\nAnd Salomon said know thou that as a phisitian putteth in a man \ngood pure oyntments & cleane, &  they thirleth the body of a man \n& heleth, So fumigacions thirleth the 4 Elemts & maketh \nto se & know heauenly things which were euermore hevenly \n& wch descendeth from heauens as be angells & spirits of the ayre & the \nsouls of dead men & deuills of lownesses & winds & spelunks [i.e. caves] & \nof deepnesses & fantasies of desert places. Wherefore know thou \nthat all spiritualls with right fumigacion shall obey to thee & \nshall come to the & they should do thy commandement.\n"

And so by the contrary is some that destroyeth them & \ntaketh away their might.

VRL 1300 40r; Halle 14-B-36 24r.\n  \n\n Salomon said for \nthis I put the houre & the tyme in the worke ffor in all \nhoure in which a man will speake to a king or to a prince, \nhe may not speake to them, neither in eich houre in which \n\n[143v]\na Sonne axeth any thing of the father he giueth to him. Therefor \nit is darke to thee to chese the tyme & the houre upon these \nthat they axert. \n\nThis is qo tempus quidam that is sometymes said \nJovis: be it done in the day of Jovis & of Veneris in the day of \nVeneris & of Martis in the day of Martis & of Saturni, in \nthe day of Sabote [=Sabbath]. And so of other that be done in invocacion \nof spirits & in all praysings of Angells. And the fumigacion of \nAngells which is pure  & cleane. Know thou that it is a \nspirituall thing & liueing & fellowshiping to heauenly \nthings. And now said Vealha. Know thou that no man ought \nto make fumigacion of preciouse things, but if he were clene \n& with cleane waters well washen & anoynted with precious \noyntments which be made cleanly & with preciouse things \n& cera alba [=white wax], balsamo, crono, & musco, Abiba tyneca [K: abitatmeca], algalea [=civet]\nulmea, thure, mirra, oleo oliuarx [=olive oil]. \n\n  \n\n  VRL 1300 40v:      \"cera alba balsamus muscus ambra thÿrus algalea almea thus mirra & oleum oliuarum.\"\n  Almost identical is Halle 14-B-36 25r: \"cera alba balsamus muscus ambra thyrus algalea almea thus et mirra et oleum oliuarum.\"\n  (\"white wax, balsam, musk, ambergris, thyrus (?), civet, storax, frankincense, myrrh, and olive oil.\")\n  \n\nAnd this oyntment be \nit well kept & well warded in a cleane  place. Of (?) him after \nthat also the clothings be cleane white, new, & good not \nbroken neither blacke. And then suffume he himself \nworshippfully & the manner of suffumeing him self ought \nto be made in 7 manners toward the East, the North, the \nWest & the South toward heauen aboce & toward the \nEarth beneath, & the 7th tyme all aboute. And as oft as \nthou dost this euer more dresse1 thy mind unto god & pray that \nhe fullfill thy will. And know thou that I found in some \nold booke that these were the more fumigacions. Thus \nthymiama graecum. mastix, laudalus, galbanum, muscha-lazarat, \nmirra, & ambra.  And these be collectors of \nspirits & placacions of them.\n\n  \n  1. dresse: direct or address.\n  \n\nAnd Solomon said when thou wilt \ngather together the spirits of the ayre do them in this manner.\n\nCleanse thou thy selfe in the better manner that thou \ncanst & go to a pit where thou wilt knowen to thee & \nsuffume it & inclepe him by his owne proper name & \nlath him or pray him & that by three nights. And if he \nappeareth send thou him to a certaine place or to an house \nor to a quadeirie that is a place there 4 wayes meett \nor to a yard or garden & suffume thou the pit toward 4 parts \n& in the place where thou lathest also as I have said & \nthen know thou that he shall come & he shall appeare to \nthee that thou shalt do this.\n\nEt dixit Hermes, quod spiritus quod apparent &c..\n\nAnd hermes \nsaid that the spirits which appeareth in this world be these.\n\n \nSome sothly be heavenly & the prophet clepeth them Angells \n& they be bright & cleare as flame or a starre as we \nhav said.

And other be watrie & \nthey be white & as bright faire or iron burnished or quicksilver. \n\n[144r]\nOther be that neigheth to men & be like to a \nwhite cloud or to a white cloath. And other be derke & dymme \n& of diverse formes which be said divells, which be hidd with \nthe wind & they be in the deepnes of the sea & of lowness of \nspirits that bring with them haules & tempests & lightning. \nAnd wisemen clepeth them huge spirits & strong. Now we \nhave said of the nature of spirits & putt to thy mind & thou \nshalt attayne with the helpe of God.\n\nDixit Raziel. Sicut in aere puro claro &c.\n\nRaziel said. As in \nthe pure, clere, & bright & cleane & peaceable ayre all things \ngladeth & ioyeth of it. So know thou that for cleannesse and \nfasting & washing of water & prayers and orison of the Creatour. \nAnd for naturall & cleane sufumigacon & very fayth or trust \nthou might please them which we hav said above. And \nRaziel said to Adam, know thou that in all maner the life \nof Angells is heele & cleane. And the suffumigium or suffumigacion \nis brede of spirits, which spirits liveth in fasting & cleanesse \n& charity, sacrifice with Orison be the houses of holy soules \n& trust is the auter [=author] of God [=good]. Wherefore eich man that hath these \nabove said in himselfe he shall attayne or neigh & he shall \nprofitt. \n\nAnd Solomon said, these be that befalleth in \nsuffumigacion. Of suffumigacion anone shall come to us fumes \n& then odour & of the fume & cloud & of the cloud an high \ncloud & wind. And of the wind ascendeth the cloud higher & \nof the cloud an high wind, & of the wind ascendeth higher & \nis made a soule & of this the spirit is made higher. And \nof the spirit an Angell of heavens & of angells light & \nthese be caused by cleane suffumigacions.\n\nAnd know thou \nthat suffumigacions be of 7 maners. Some sothly sharpe \n& other penetratit or persinge, other sweete smelling \nother stinkinge, other simple, other meeke, other of grife \nother sothly of peace. And everych of these maners is after \nhis odour said & nature & complexion. Wherefore Hermes \nsaid that as coldnes congeleth water with his cold. And as \nwater of the sea is congealed with great heat & as azerta cona \ncongeleth the water of wells. And everych of these \ncongeleth the water, one with coldnes & another with hotnes, \nanother by arte, another by nature & the matter is made one \nbody & one gobbett [=piece]. And know thou that good suffumiacon \ngathereth together & constrayneth & maketh spirits to appeare \nin the ayre & secrete or privy things & it maketh them to \ntake a body which our eyne [=eyes] seeth. And Salomon said as the \nAdamant draweth yron [=iron] to him self, so know thou that suffumigacon \ngathereth together & draweth the spirits of the ayre \n& maketh them to come to the place where thou doeth it\n& wold gather them together. And the wise men says suffumigacon\nis like to the roote of arzolle for as it ioyneth together \n\n[144v]\ngobbets of flesh into one. So suffumigacons gathereth together \nspirits of heavenly or heaven with the 4 Elements & they make \nthat they taketh a body & spirits taketh visible bodies & \npalpable. And a body taken they fullfilleth that they be axed \nof them & that to likenes of a mirrour to which if there be \nsett before what figure thou wolt a like appeareth within. \n\nThus fumigacion made cleanly & invocacion in the houre after \nthe spirits proportionall. The spirits appeare to us & new operacions \n& workings with fullfillinge upon the thing which thou \naskest. And be thou never deceived in the knowledge of \nsuffumigacions & put thou thy mind in them least they be \ntransposed, & thou shalt fullfill as that were & after \nthat thou doest as he said. And Salomon said I will touch \nsome what to thee of the nature of suffumigacions. In \ncolericke suffumigacions, who that useth it much, it \nmaketh to see in sleepe, or in sothnes greene things & yelow \n& diverse colours. Melancholious fumigacion sheweth \nleady [=grayish] things. Sanguine fumigacions sheweth red things, & \notherwhile it is sheweinge of purpure colour. Phlegmaticke \nfumigacion sheweth white things & faire and so understand \nthou after that the nature were & the appearing of \nspirits & of their colours & visions & the worke of them shall \nbe after the sharpnes of it & the goodnes & direccion of \nfumigii, is fullfilling of the thing after that the ymage \nwere firmed & the orison of the thing nempned & the \ntrust for all is in the intention of the man and in the houre in \nwhich it is done.\n\nNow we have said how every of the \nPlanets hath his fumigacions. Now say we the fumigacions of \nthe 12 signes & of the 36 faces of them. \n\nAries holdeth by himself mirtam. \n\nTaurus costum, \n\n, masticen, \n\n Musthalazerath, \n\n thus, \n\n Clastem, \n\n galbanum,\n\n opopanec, \n\n lignum aloes, \n\n asafetidam,\n\n euforbium, \n\n thymiama [=thyme].\n\n[Incenses for each decan.]\n\nThe first face of Arietis holdeth mirtam, the 2 stamoneam, \nthe 3 piper nigrum. \n\nThe first of Tauri costum, the 2 cardamom, the 3 cassiam.\n\nThe 1 of Geminorum masticen, the 2 cinamomum, the 3 cipresenum.\n\nThe 1 of  mastum, the 2 succum, the 3 anisum.\n\nThe first of  thus, the 2 lignum balsami, the 3 nucem mustatam [=nutmeg].\n\nThe first of  sandalos, the 2 crocus, the 3 masticen. \n\nThe first of  galbanum, the 2 befor, the 3 mirtum.\n\n[ is missing.]\n\nThe 1 of  lignum aloes, 2 folia lauri, the 3 gariofilium.\n\nThe first of  Asam feti, the 2 Colofoniam, the 3 piper longum.\n\nThe first of   euforbeum, the 2 reubarbarum [=rhubarb], the 3 stamonea.\n\nThe 1 of  thymiama [=thyme], the 2 crocum, the 3 sandalus albus.\n\nNota secundum Hermetis de fumigiis.\n\nAnd Hermes said , , & \n withholdeth eich choleric \nspice & bitter, &  , \n& , melancholius & stipticke. \n\n[145r]\n   \nsanguine & sweet, \n  &  \nphlegmatike & salt of \nsavour.\n\nAnd this Salomon holdeth for the more naturall for such \nspices we give & with them we suffume. And which maner fumigacion \nwe give to the planetts, such we give to the dayes & houres.\n\n  \nAs the Sonday the first houre is of Sola & all the day together, we should \ngive thus, masticen, & mustum. As we have said of planets in the \nbeginning of this booke of thymiamatum. And so understand thou of all \nother. \n\n[Incenses for the four seasons]\n\nKnow thou the suffumigacion to tymes. \n\n  \n\n  VRL 1300 43v; Halle 14-B-36 26v.\n  \n\nIn primo tempore lignum aloes, thus, & crocum. In the second tyme thymiama, costum, \nmasticen. In the 3 tyme, sandalo, cassia, mertum. In the 4 time \nmustum, succum & lignum balsami. And he gave to eich of \nthe 4 tymes their spices or kinds, so he giveth to eich month one \nspice in order.\n\n[Incenses for the four cardinal directions]\n\nDicamus nunc suffumigia 4 partium mundi &c.\n\n  \n\n  VRL 1300 43v; Halle 14-B-36 26v. \n  \n\nSay we now suffumigacions of the 4 parties of the world & of the \n4 Elements, for all things that be in this world be compounded of the \nelements or simples. Suffumigacions of the 4 parties of this world be \nthese. Upon the party of the East & the fire serveth Ambra, \nMuscus & alba cera that is white waxe. Upon the party of the South \n& the Earth, algalia [=civet], almea [=storax], & tyriaca [=theriac].1 Upon the party of the \nWest & the ayre, balsamus, Camphora & clarum olivanum [=olive oil]. Upon \nthe North & the water lignum aloes, mux mustate, & macis.2\n\n  \n\n  1. VRL 1300 reads: tinata; Halle 14b36 reads: cinata. \n  I have not been able to identify a botanical with that name.\n  Folger and Royal MS 17Axlii both read theriac.\n  \n\n  2. VRL 1300: lignum aloes, muc, & macis.\n  \n\nAnd Salomon said, eich man that wold do any thing by this booke \nput he the mind to the chapters of thymiamate that he \nknow the kings & iustly can meddle them. And so know \nthou that thou might easily worke by hit & without travaile \nthou might fullfill all thing that thou desirest to set. Now \nwe have fullfilled one Chapter of fumigiis or fumigacions & \nwe will say furthermore hit upon which was our intention \nwith the helpe of God.\n\n[Liber temporum]\n\n  \n\n  VRL 1300 44r; Halle 14-B-36 27r.\n  \n\nHere beginneth the 4 booke that \nspeaketh upon tymes of the yeare.\n\nIn nomine dei pii, Incipio scribere librum istum &c.\n\nIn \nthe name of the meke god I begin to write this booke that \nis said Cephar Raziel, which the Angell Raziel gave to \nAdam & it shall speake upon the 4 tymes of the yeare & month \n& day with his night how we should nempne eich thing. And know \neich man that this is said the booke of tymes, & the Angell gave \nit that is said mighty & great by the mandement of the Creator \nquicke God & in all things mighty. And for that Adam should \nknow all things by hit which he would know in this world what \nit is, what it was, & what it shall be in all things. 12 months of \nthe yeare & dayes & houres & that by order & similitude of \ncleane fasting & of washings of sacrifices of fumigacions \nmade by 7 dayes ere the first mone [=Moon] were & ere the sunne \nshould ascend his tale i.e. the ascendent. And ere the sunne should \nascend upon his starre. Zedet i.e. Jovis. And they should be\n\n[145v]\n\nnempned in this booke by month, holy angells that have might \nupon the 7 heavens formed of fire & the beholding of them fire \n& the life of him is fire. And they seeme clothed with fire \n& they be covered with fire & from the fire went out, & in the \nfire they dwell & they be of great fellowships mighty upon \nthe 12 months of the yeare by the precept of the Creator of it \nwhich said the world by hit, & all angells be & were before \nit. & there be 7 powers before that face of it, & to eich of them is \ngiven might & hath a day of the month & of the weeke. And of \nthem some be standing in environ, & some be some be sytting in chaires \nwith great honour serving to the Creator & they be ever \nmore ready & bound to goe out & to entre to come & to go & with \nall good & evill, what ever is made & to enchaunte & to put \ndowne & to cover privy things & to discover or to make revelasion.\nAnd all this that we have said by the mandement of God. \n& all the more angells & lesse & the princes of them with \ntheir powers with their orders, or with their fellowships, they \nclepeth themselves everich with their names & which be Selly, \ni.e. high or soveraigne evermore they prayse God the Creator, \nwhich formed them. And allso all the powers of all heaven \nin the month & in the day in which he formed them. And they \nbe all speaking to himself together as men. And Raziel \nsaid that these angells wrote these names & this booke, \n& he said that there be above 7 angells mighty upon 7 starres \n& these be 7 potestatesor powers mighty upon 7 days of the \nweeke & they be keepers of them & of the 24 houres of \nthe day & of the 7 heavens & of the 12 signs & of all other \nthings that governeth this world. And Raziel said to Adam \nbehold, know, & withhold these 7 powers or potestates, which \nhave power in the 7 heavens & the 7 stars. The names of \nwhich be these.\n\nSabaday, that is , \n\nZedet that is , \n\nMadyn that is , \n\nHamina that is , \n\nNoga i.e. , \n\nCocab i.e. , \n\nLabana i.e. .\n\nThe names of the 7 heavens in which they be borne be these \nSamayn, Raquia, Saaquyn, Mahum, Maon, Zebal, Araboc.\n\nUpon Samayn goeth ,\nupon Raquia ,\n& upon Araboc ,\n& so understand thou of other. The names of Angells that \nhave power upon the 7 starrs & goeth upon the 7 heavens \n& otherwhile in their chaires be these. Capziel, Satquiel, \nSamael, Raphael, <raphael,> [sic] Amael [*Anael], Michael, Gabriel. And the \npower of these is that Capziel is the power of Sabaday. Satquiel of \nZedet & Samael of Madyn & Raphael of Hamina, Amael of \nNoga, Michael of Cocab, Gabriel of Labana. And everich of \nthese sitteth in his heaven & the meynees [=their company or crew] of them all about. \nAnd they be of divers colours. <And they be of divers colours> as white, \nblacke, red, yellow, greene, ledy, pardi viati, medled over gilt \n& of the colour of a Peacocks feather & of many other colours.\n\nThese be the Angells that have power upon the 12 months \nof the yeare. The names of the months be these, of the yeare \n\n[146r]\n\nNysan, Yar, Zevan, tamus, Abelul, Tysiryn, Marquesnam, Quislep, \nTobez, or Thebeth, Sabat, Adar, Post adar, Postmodo.\n\n  \n\n  i.e. Nisan, Iyar, Sivan, Tammuz, Av, Elul, Tishrei, Marcheshvan, Kislev, Tevet, Shevat, Adar, and \non leap years, Adar II.\n  \n\nThe names \nof Potestates be these & they be 12 capitalls, that is one upon \neuerich month of Lune, & the rather is Oriel, Sasuyel, \nAmariel, Noriel, Beraquiel, Maguynya, Scufriel, Barsiel, Adoniel, \nAnael, Gabriel, Romiel, Laciel. And euerich of these hath \nso many potestates, helpers, more or greater as there be days \nin the month or many other seruants of them. And with the \naforesaid Angells a man may know all thing that is to come \nin euery day & euery houre with the proper signs of them who \nthat knoweth them well. If he woll know of many \nReynes or few or when they shall be or if they shall be or no \n& the day & houre when they shall falle. And a man \nmay know by them which is his signe & his starre. And he may \nknow of his life if it shall be long doinge or of short in the \nworld & other things either for a sick man or an hoole [=hail i.e. healthy] either \nfor a man or for a woman. Or he may know a sutill understanding \nor sharpe. he may know what is to come & to do with \nit that he woll. And the dayes of the yeare or of solis, alone \nin which may be done the working of this booke by 365 & the \n4 part of one day in the worke of dayes. The yeares of lune be \notherwhile 360 dayes or 4 houres & 46 minutes after the yeare \nof lune. And the fullfilling of tymes is this. In one tyme be \n3 months, & when the tymes be 4 Sothly til to 12. And knowe \nthou that Nizan that is the first month entreth in the first day \nof the first moone wheneuer were Luna prima of the month \nof Martii, & so of other. And the first very tyme is from the first \npoint in which the  entreth into Arietem till it enter the \nfirst point of Cancri [=Cancer], & the 2 from  into \nam & the 3 from \n into  & the 4 from \n into Arietem, & this is the better distinction \nof tymes. And in the hour in wch Raziel gaue the booke \nto Adam Of tymes, & months, & names of things then was \nadam conforted only when in thilke day fillen lightnings \nmoued & thunders & coriscations appreariden & there was in that \nday great tempest in all the world, both in the land, & in the ayre \n& in the sea. And in the houre in which the Angell Raziel \nopened this booke & gave it to Adam, then he gaue to him \nmight & strength & suretie in all the wordes of this booke \n& miracules that be in it. And when this booke fell before \nthe face of Adam. Then Adam dread full much & quoke of \ngreat dred, & fill downe into the earth as though he had bin \ndead. Then the Angel Raziel said to Adam rise & be thou \ncomforted, for know thou that a very soth fast spirit hath \ndescended in thé in the high heauens which hath lightend thee \n& hath put in this houre in thee knoweing &d might & that \nthou shallt attayne yt thou shalt axe. And I say to thee that \nthou consider in this booke & beholde in it, & by it thou shalt \nknow & understand what euer was & that is & that shall be after \nthee. And in that houre in wch this booke was giuen to Adam \nfire fell upon the brincke of the flode of paradise & the Angell \n\n[146v]\nascended by the flame of the fire to heauen. And an Angell \ndescended in similitude of a cloud white & spake with him \nplaynely, And come to him as a man well bright &d cleare \nlike to the clearenes of a starre in his body &d full of many \nother all about & in ascending when he was seuered. Euermore \nAdam was like to a lambe which formed well bright as the \nflame of fire & clearer then the fire of a furnice in wch gold \nis purged. And then Adam saw this & found & knew that \nof the Lord of all worlds which is a great king & mighty in all \nthings. This booke was sent for he. And then he considered \nor looked in it with holynes & cleanes. And then he beheld in \nit all thing that he would know in this world. And this was \nthe first word Adam had with the Angell Raziel. And [er]go \nhe considered in it & gouerned him self by it. Salomon said upon \nthe aforesaid reason aboue after that the Angell Raziell said \nto Adam that it behoueth know the tymes & the month & \nthe day.

And the names of Angells that haue might upon the \nayre be these: Rafael, guabriel, Michael, chorubyn, seraphyn, \norychyn, pantaceron, Mycraton, Sandalson, barachyel, ragehyel, \ntobyel.\n\nAnd name thou them in all things that thou shalt do in the \nayre & thou shalt profitte well with the helpe of god.\n\nIsta sunt nomina aquarum & maris in 4 temporibus &c.\n\nThese be the \nnames of the waters & of the Sea in the 4 tymes.\n\nIn the first tyme it \nis named Argustiz, in the 2 theon, in the 3 Maddriel, in the 4 Sebylgnadar. And the names of Angells of waters & of the Sea, \nbe these: Urpenyel, armaryel, yyamnel, abrastas, Sapyel, \nvyotan, oryel, bachmyel, poracknel, acceryel, gallyel zsmyel.\n\nAnd name thou them upon waters & upon the Sea and \n\n[150v]\nthou shalt profitt.\n\nThese be the names of the Earth in 4 tymes.\n\nIn the first tyme it is said inguedon, in the 2 yabassa, in the 3 \nCebel, in the 4 Aradon, & the Angells of the Earth be these: \nSamael, yatayel, baranyel, Oryel, arfanyel, tatgriel, danael, \naffariel, pactryel, bael, byenyel.\n\nAnd thou shalt name these \nnames of Angells upon the Earth in these that thou hast don \nin it.\n\nThese be the names of lowneses in the 4 tymes.\n\nIn the first tyme it is said Haham, & his Angiel is Satuyel, in \nthe 2 Cypaon, & his angell is Jacyel, In the 3 aeresac & his \nangell is ababact, in the 4 aycyhambabo, & his angell is Caanyel.\n\nThese be the names of the 4 parties of the world. In the 4\ntymes.\n\nIn the first tyme the East is said Acbedan, in the \n2 Cadrenac, in the 3 Abriel, in the 4 Acritael.\n\nThese be the names of the North part in the 4 tymes: In the \nfirst tyme it is said Hemnyna, in the 2 abdich, In the 3 galgadar, \nin the 4 rabbysor.\n\nThese be the names of the west part. In \nthe first tyme Mahanahym, in the 2 Sitgor, in the third Zarzyr, in \nthe 4 Rabyur.\n\nThese be the names of the south part. In \nthe 1 tyme Mansor, in the 2 Alparon, in the 3 Machuyel, \nin the 4 Thamny.\n\nThese be the names of Angells in the 4 \nparts of the world. In the parte of the East these haue might \nor power: guabriel, raphael, Uryel, in the part of the North \nthese: Adryel, yamyel, Zabdyel. And in the parte of the West \nthese: Adtryel, Samael, Joel.  And in the parte of the South these: \nCocabyel, Saryel, Mychael.\n\nAnd name thou them upon all \nthings that thou dost in the 4 parts of the world & thou \nshalt profitt.\n\nNames of the Planets proper in 4 tymes.\n\nIsta sunt nomina 7 stellarum qui sunt & vadunt &c.\n\nThese be the names of the 7 Stares that be & goeth in the 7 \nheauens euerich by himselfe: Sabaday, Zedet, Madyn, \nHamyna, Noga, Cocab, Labana. And euerrich of these \nhath his owne proper name upon the 4 times of the yeare \nas we shall say in this Chapter beneth. And Salomon said \nin explanation of this place. Wherefore euerich planet & \neuerich thinge before said changeth his name in eich tyme \nfor his thinge, for heere standeth some tree & from thilke \ntree cometh to us 4 things, & of these 4 things, the 1 is \nwhen it buryoneth, the 2 is the flower, the 3 is the fruite, the \n4 is the seed, when it is in it. Ergo the Sunne is said in the first time \nhott & moist, in the 2 hot & dry, in the 3 Cold & dry, in the 4 Colde & \nmoist. These be the workings of the Sunne &d the properties of \nit upon all things. And for a other reason the names of things \naboue said be changed in 4 parts of the yeare, ffor euerich \ntyme hath his Nature & his complexion in himselfe as \n\n[151r]\n\nwe have said of water which is in the first tyme temperate \nAnd in the 2 hotte & in the 3 rotten & in the 4 congeled. \nAnd so other things of the world euerich by himself. \n\nTo ensample why Raziel put his name to eich thing. In each \nthing be the 4 lords that haue might in eich thing & euerych \nin his tyme. And it is said that there be 4 Elements whereof \none is fire, which hath might in the first tyme & so other. Wherefore \nknow thou that euerich thing changeth his name as first \nwe say a man: a child. And then a youngling, & then a middle \nman, & the 4th tyme an old man. And so things chaungeth \ntheir names who will clepe them a leader & this is in a man.\nAnd so understand thou of Mettall, & in all things that wexeth \n& liueth. \n\nAnd Salomon said & all other that it was more iust [=just] that \neich thing should haue 7 names then 4, for that all they \nmight descend of 4 bodise, & to them is giuen all the might.\nSothely they put 4 names to euery thing that it were more easy \nto worke. These 4 names be assigned upon the city of dauid my \nffather & myne, which had many names. Sothly Isaac the wiseman \nsaid that the first name was Remusale. And then \nJebuysalem, Jeroboam, Jerusalem. And these names this \nCyty receiued for 4 Lords that were in it, for euerich put \nto his proper name  & for this like things of this world receiueth \n4 names in themself or 7 or more after that god hath ordeyned. \nAnd ergo no man marvaile of these names of things in 4 times. \n\nIn \nthe higher heauen that is the first from the ouer partie & it \nis the 7 from the neather in hit serueth Sabaday. And his \nangell Capcyel. \n\nIn the first tyme Sabaday is said Cuernes. \nIn the 2 Palycos, In the 3 quyrtypos. In the 4 Panpotes. \n\nIn the \n6 heauen serueth Zedet & his angell is Satquiel, & the name \nJouis. In the first tyme it is amanor. In 2 Sahybor. In \nthe 3 Saym. In the 4 canynyel. \n\nIn the 5 heuen serueth \nMadyn, & his Angell Balquiel, & the name of Martis in \nthe 1 tyme is said aaryn, in the 2 Duron. In the 3 bearon, \nIn the 4 Pantefos. \n\nIn the 4th heauen serueth hamina \n& his angell dandanyel. In the first time the name of \nSolis is said halyom, in the 2 Adocham, In the third Cantopos. \nIn the 4 Pantasus. \n\nIn the 3 heauen serueth \nNoga & his Angell adzdyel. In the 1 time the name of \nVeneris is said Aporydicy. In the 2 Calyzo, in the 3 nympatz, \nin the 4 pontos. \n\nIn the second heauen serueth \nCocab, And his angell Satquiel. In the first tyme \nMercurius is said armis, in the 2 anyocus. In the 3 Tholos. \nIn the 4 Ancholos. \n\nIn the first heauen serueth Labana \n& his angell Anael. In the first Luna is said Saluiti, \nIn the 2 Sarico. In the 3 Naspilij. \n\n[151v]\n\nIn the 4th Affryquyn. And know thou that thou shalt name the names \nof the starrs & of her Angells with their names in their 4 \ntymes & thou shalt profit when thou shalt know anything \nof them.\n\nHere beginneth the 5 booke\nthat treateth of cleanesse.\n\nDixit Salomon revelatum fuit mihi de isto libro &c. \n\nSalomon said It was shewed to me of this booke of Raziel & of \nmany angells after that I had this booke & of these \nwch norished powers & vertues & matter & stength of \nye 7 potestates aboue & that by the mandement [mandment: commandment] & \nobedience of the Creator or maker of the world. And they \nsaid thus. Salomon thou hast axed witte & wisedome \n& fairenes & might in will complete & nempned full \ngreat for euermore upon Earths. And know thou that \nall kings & lesse men that should come after thee & wch \nshould here speake of thee, shall loue thee, & worship thee \n& should set price of thee & shall prayse thee & keep thou \nthis booke & worke thou with it with reuerence and \ncleannesse. And Salomon said to the benigne Angell \nNatanael, which hath might in the ayre, And this evermore \nwas fellowshipped to Salomon. / which be thilke 7 \nbodies which be seene aboue bright, faire, cleane & cleare, \nwch ceaseth neuer to go, neither the wayes of them be void \n& they faileth neuer, but euermore dureth goynge their \nwayes. And it that taryeth more in going his way fulfilleth \nit in 30 yeares. And then they appeare such as they were \nbefore & which went before thus they sawe. And thus it is \nsaid that they should be how long god would. And thus \nI say of an 100 yeares & a 1000 that they neuer be \nchanged neither in quantity nor in colour, nor in might \nnor in moveing, but we haue found them as the prophetts \n& other old men founden. An[d] the angell Natanael \nsaid to Salomon, the 7 bright bodies which thou seest \naboue be put beneath & they in going upward holdeth in \nballance or in rule the 4 elemts beneath. And therfore \nthe moueing of them cesseth not for such might the \nCreator gaue to them. And know thou that the matter of \nthem is simple & pure without corruption & euermore \ndurable. And the state of them is likened to the Lord \nthat formed them, although they obey to him in all \nthings. And Natanael said to Solomon know thou \nthat in the heauens of these 7 bright bodies be angells \n\n[152r]\nwithout number mighty in all things. And everiche of them hath his \nproper mighte & his strength & vertue. And they be unlike among \nthemself as men together or other beasts. & eueriche serueth of \nhis office to the Creator that formed them or made them. \nAnd Salomon said to Nathanael wch is the life or the might or \nthe seruice that these angells doth. And Nathanaell said the \nlife of them is of cleannesse of Oryson, & of trustines & the \nmight of them is of suffumigii, holocausti & sacraficii. And the \nseruice of them is, that when the Creator woll they go from place \nto place when any cleane man hath prayed [to] the Creator as it \nbeseemeth. And then they do good or Euill as the Creator woll \nfor in them is power, scyence & will complete. And Salomon said \nwhich be these 7 bright bodies & how be they named. And of \nwhat things serueth euerich. And Nathanael said that same \nthat Raziel said to Adam. The higher of these that goeth \nslower is said Sabaday. And all the Remes of his heauen be \nfull of yse [ice], snow, & haile, & wrath, rancor, & coldnes, & all the \nAngells that be there clothed with darknes full derke & the \ngreatnes of them be full high & full long & small & upon the \nEarthes & upon deuills & upon darknesses & coldnesses & dryness. \nAnd this hath power upon winds of this nature & they have \npower of doing good & euill & the Angell of it is Boel \ncrowned upon all other.\n\nIn the second heauen \nstandeth Zedet [Zedek] and all the Remes of hym.\n\nDixit Salomon Rex filius Regis Dauid &c.\nSalomon the king the Sunn of Dauid the king said, that was king \nof Jerusalem, of Surye & Damaske of Egypt, Lord of \nBabylony, Prince of Scyences, couetouse of Cleanesses, \nensercher of Priuities, keeper of good true men, auvyder \nof leasing of poore men, of vertues desirer upon l~re vertues \n& spedefullnesses of words busyly thinking, & most \nsuttily [subtily] in minde enserchinge. I have enquired & knowne that in \nwords is power, vertue, & effect & of all humour hool [whole] & health \n& there may be sufficient fulfillinge. And he said I see that \nthe most fame is of wise men & prophetes by words & bookes \nwhich they haue lest into testimony of them. And I see that \nthe sonns of Adam, & of Hermes & of Noe [=Noah] & their sonns & many \nof other prophets haue left bookes by their death by which they \nshould claryfy their fame, & anentes men glory should remayne. \nAnd I see that my father king David compowned or made \nsome booke in which bee contayned all orysons which he might \nknowe & find, which sothely latin men that is Romayns clepeth \nthe saut' [psalter]. Which sith it is of prayers alone & of holy names \nof the Creator it is named the head of Orisons. In the same \nbooke king Dauid wrote all things what euer he might \nknowe of Patriarkes & old wise men to the praysing of the Creatour. \nI sothly king Salomon long studying in holy words \n\n[152v]\nwhich vertues & miracles I found to be, while there is \nfullfilled in eich working trust & will. And I saw the books \nin which while I studied long I know Adam & hermes & \nNoe [=Noah] & Moyses & many other most wise men, I know \nof great privitees & the vertues of his books.\n\nCum ergo veteres & antiquos Sapientes &c. When go [therefore] I understode \nold wise men to haue made books how or with what witt or \nwith what art I might know the sciences of all the foresaid \nI enquired. And there answered some old man of good minde \n& understanding which was cleped Zebraymayl. And the \nking said Adam had a maker & Mr that is to wite or Lord \nmaker & Gabriel to Mr. ffurthermore Hermes the \ndiscreete & most wise man & Moyses had a Mr & a freind \nthat is to wit Crotum. Aaron sothly had a freind of \nwhich go [therefore] is made resistence that a wise man may not be \nwithout a Mr. how arrettest yu tho to [thou too] mow [may] be wise wth out \nMr But that thou be wise, these I know to be necessary \nto thee. A wise Mr & discreete, longe, & continuall study \nmany olde bookes of great wise men made, oft & ofter ouer \nred perfitt & amended, glad & continuall health of thy \nbody, long life without cures [cares?] & trauayles quiete. \n\nSalomon said to the wise man, is not this possible to be done \nby a sharter way then that thou hast said aboue. Zebraymayl \nanswered, king, by a lighter & shorter way then \nthis ne unknow thou not to mowe be done. To whom \nSalomon [said,] how therefore. To whom the wise man [replied,] open thou \nprivily & fully the arke of the Testament noman knowing \nor understanding. In which all secrets or priuitees & old \nwisdomes & words of great power & of vertue thou shalt \nfind. By which not only thou shalt know things a passed but \nthose that be present and those that be to come. Salomon \nanswered, for this that thou hast answered to me I giue \nthancks to that high & blessed Creator which reigneth wthout \nbeginning & liueth without end wch after yt it pleased to him \nall things with word alone he formed or made & there is \nnot any more noble or mightier then he wthout whom no \nvertue or power is which giueth wisedome to wise men, \nhe is that is of all things the first, syth he is wthout beginning \nof all things the last, sith there is none end of him, \nthis is of all things maker of none y made of whom the \nReme or reigning is & shallbe of whom all works be good \nAnd of whom the will ouer all is free sith there is none \nthat may againe say to him. \n\nSalomon trowinge \n\n[153r]\nor trustinge to Zebraymayl made the arke of the testamony [testament] to \nbe brought before him. And he sought all the books of Moysy [=Moses] & \nof Aaron, of Adam, & Noe [=Noah], & of their sons & of hermes & of other \nprophets, & all other which he might find of the miracles of Words \n& the vertues of them. And he sought all the old idolls of heathen \nmen & Images of divers tongs hauing writeings & all things \ngrauen which might be founde by all parts of the world he \nmade in his palace to be gathered together. And he brought \nforth Mrs of euerych of the 72 on which should expownd to him \nprivy letters or hid y. c. in ebrue [Hebrew], Caldey, Cyriac [Syriac,] greeke written. \nAnd to him they should expowne that were hidde. And when the \nletters were expownded he saw the nure parte to accord with it \nin vertues of wordes.\n\nRex ergo Salomon fecit archam nocte quadam apperiri &c.\nTherefore [King] Salomon made the arke some night to be \nopened, that in the arke with reasons afterward we should be \nlearned. Salomon said after that the soueraigne & the allmighty \nCreator had infused the grace of his spirit in me. I opened \nthe arke of the Testament in which I found all \n\nthings which \nlong and studiously I had sought, Among which I found the \nbooke which is cleped1 Raziel which the Creator sent to \nAdam by the angell Raziel when upon the brincks of the floud \nof paradise weepinge the creator he prayed & of him forgiunes \nof his sinnes he besought. And I found the booke which the \nCreator gaue to Moyses in the hill, when he made him \npartnes of his priuites in which 3 books, that is 3 reasons2 I \nfound.\n\n  \n  1. Cleped: named.\n\n  2. K: Orisons.\n  \n\nThe first the prophets clepeth Semiphoras which \nthe Creator gaue to Adam in paradise. The 2 booke is wch \nthe Creator gaue to Adam in paradice in the houre of necessity or \nneede. The 3 is wch the Creator gaue to Moyses in the hall [sic hill] of \nSinay after that he had fullfilled the fasting. & Salomon said \nI found in the Arke a pott full of Manna & the yard1 of \nMoyses wch was changed into a Serpent, & eft from a serpent into \na yard. And the Tables of the Lawe & gobbetts of the first letters \nwhich Moyses wrought* for the synne of the people brake. In \nthe ground sothly 3 of the Arke I founde some golden tables \nquadrate or 4 cornered in which were 15 preciouse stones 12 \ntribes or lynages of Israel by similitude likened, & in euerich \nstone were written the holy high names of the Creator of the booke \nSemyforas [Semiphoras] outdrawen. And I found sund (?) boxe of marble haueing \ngreene colour as Jaspis coloured. \n\nAnd in this boxe were 7 figures \n& in eich figure 7 great & vertuous names of the Creator to Moyses \ntold. And other 7 which the Creator taught Adam in paradise. And \nthis is a secret or privity wch much leyned (? K: leaned) & couered ought worlly [K: worshipfully] to \nbe kept. I founde also about the extremities of the Arke 24 \nrings with names & figures of the Creator written Semiforas with \ndiuers colours written or figured. I my self Salomon haue minde  \n\n[153v]\nto haue had one of thilke rings in which I know to haue \nfound such vertue when I said make to rayne, it \nreigned, whan I said est of thou hast made to rayne, so \nmake thilke rayne to cease, it ceased. And beside Jerusalem \nthe same reme aswell of tempests as of raynes \nit did or made. And Salomon said I found Semoforas \nwith wch Moyses made the plagues in Egypt with \nwch he dryed the red Sea, wth wch he drew out water of \nthe stone, wth wch he knew all the cleanesses of his people \nwith which he ouercame princes & kings & mighty men \nwth wch what euer he would do he did. And that he wold \ndestroy he destroyed, wth wch what euer els good or of euil \nhe would he fullfilled at his owne will.\n\n  \n  1. yard: staff.\n\n  *. In margin: wroth.\n\n  3. sothly: truly.\n  \n\nCapitulum Explanationis istius nominis Semoforas &c \nThe Capliter [chapter] of Explanation of this name Semiforum &c. it is \nthat angells & deuells & windes & men as well quicke as \ndead. And all spiritts & all bodies dredeth Semiforas sothly \nis said the first secret or priuily, & great old & muchy \nleyned & hid of great vertue & power to gett what \neuer he woud. Semiforas is a word which ought not \nto be shewed to all men meither by hit but with great \nnecessity or anguish ought any man to worke. And then \nwith dread of the Creator he ought cleanly & meekely & \ndeuoutly to name it.Also Semiforas is roote & begining & \nfundament of Orison, ensample of good life, trust of \nmans body the Orison or prayer of a iust man the Creator \ndreadinge. Salomon said aboue Sem~ [Semiforas] these be necessary wth \nmeeknes fastinge, wth Orison, trust, wth charity, cleanesse \nwith patience meekenes & constance of a man wth not wch \nyou might worke nothing with wch what euer thou \nwolt thou shalt get when all vertues in workinge \nby Sem~ ought to be, netheles these 7 that in meekenes \ntruelly, pacience abstinence, trust, charity, mercy ought in \nhim principally to be had or to abounde.\n\nSi ergo per Semiphoras operaris volumus vz quod sumus &c. \nIf ergo [therefore] wee wod worke by Semiphoras It behoueth that we be \nbright or cleane of body & in trust stedfast & from \nfalsnes & leasing1 fully departed. It behoueth also to \ndread the Creator & the creatures of him. Among wch \nwe ought to dread most the Sunne wch giueth to us \n\n[154r]\n\nlight & derknes cold & heat wch is cause of changing of \ntymes & of temperance of the ayre & of herbs. We ought \nalso to know the beholdinge (?) of the mone & the month wch \n5 by hit 12 & 5, 13 be accompted as is said Nyssan yar tina~ &c.2 \nAnd we ought to know the waxeing \n\n& decreasinge of the \nmoone when by it all creatures as the Sea, floudes & wells, \n& all the neather bodies waxinge & decreasing taken & bloode \nin the veynes & marrow in the head & in the bones after that \nthe moone taketh waxeinge & decreasing they be norished in thilke \nalso fusion and [in marg: Mercury] or molting of mettalls ne doubt thou not the \nvertue of the moone to worke. We ought also to know Sabaday \ni. Saturnum, by whom hunger & derth & all anguish in londs \nbefalleth. We ought also to know & dread Zedet [Zedek] i. Jouem [Jupiter], by whom \nhonour & health, & righteousnes & all good is had. We should \nalso know & dread Madyn i. Martem [Mars], of whom colours & strifes \n& hate & battayles & leasing & all euills cometh. We ought also \nto know & dread hamina i. Solem [the Sun], by whom we haue light and \ndarknes clearnes, by whom tymes as euill unto good & good into euill \nbe transmuted or chaunged. We ought also to know & dread Nogam \ni. Venerem [Venus], by whom we haue meat & drinke & all necessarys \nor things that be needfull, by whom peace & loue & dilection \namong men is made fast & stable. We ought also to know & \ndread Cocab i.e. Mercur [Mercury], for he is nigher to us than all untake \nthe Moone by whom merchandiss & vendisions or sellings & all \nsecular things be exercised. Therefore behold you tho that be \nsaid & most the Spirits aboue said & thus thou shalt profitt \n& what euer thou shalt axe of the Creator rightfully \nthou shalt haue.\n\n  \n\n  1. leasing: lying.\n  \n\n  2.

And I my self Salomon, haue proued \nthe dayes & houres of Madyn [Mars] & Sabaday [Saturn] which I foiund full grevouse \nfor to worke. I haue proued also the hours of Zedet & Noga. \nAnd I saw that what euer I would worke of them lightlie I \nwrought. The hours of Cocab & Labana otherwhile be greuous \notherwhile good I haue proued to be. And I saw that in the day & in \nthe houre co~ia, nothing of my will I might fullfill. And know \nthat the spirits aboue said anentis diuers men diuersly be named. \nFfor the first in Ebrue, Sabaday in arabicke Zoal, in greeke or grice \nfenes, in Latin Saturnus is cleped or nempned.

When he would \nworke by Semiforum first ere he beginn any thinge it \nbehoueth him to name the 7 names of angells, for some angells \nbe upon the 7 heauens. And upon the 7 planets & upon the 7 days \nof the weeke & upon the 7 mettalls & upon the 7 colours. And \nupon the 7 words haueinge power. The names of which be \nthese Raphael, gabriel, Samael, Michael, Saq'el, Anael, \nCapciel.

          "text": "Of the sage Solomon.\n\nBlessed art thou, O Lord God, who didst give Solomon such authority. Glory\nto thee and might unto the ages. Amen.\n\n2. And behold, when the Temple of the city of Jerusalem was being builded,\nand the artificers were working thereat, Ornias the demon came among them\ntoward sunset; and he took away half of the pay of the chief-deviser's (?)\nlittle boy, as well as half his food. [16] He also continued to suck the\nthumb of his right hand every day. And the child grew thin, although he was\nvery much loved by the king.\n\n3. So King Solomon called the boy one day, and questioned him, saying: \"Do I\nnot love thee more than all the artisans who are working in the Temple of\nGod? Do I not give thee double wages and a double supply of food? How is it\nthat day by day and hour bt hour thow growest thinner?\"\n\n4. But the child said to the king: \"I pray thee, O king. Listen to what has\nbefallen all that thy child hath. After we are all released from our work on\nthe Temple of God, after sunset, when I lie down to rest, one of the evil\ndemons comes and takes away from me one half of my pay and one half of my\nfood. Then he also takes hold of my right hand and sucks my thumb. And lo,\nmy soul is opressed, and so my body waxes thinner every day.\"\n\n5. Now when I Solomon heard this, I entered the Temple of God, and prayed\nwith all my soul, night and day, that the demon might be delivered into my\nhands, and that I might gain authority over him. And it came about through\nmy prayer that grace was given to me from the Lord Sabaoth by Michael his\narchangel. [He brought me] a little ring, having a seal consisting of an\nengraved stone, and said to me: \"Take, O Solomon, king, son of David, the\ngift which the Lord God has sent thee, the highest Sabaoth. With it thou\nshalt lock up all demons of the earth, male and female; and with their help\nthou shalt build up Jerusalem. [But] thou [must] wear this seal of God. And\nthis engraving of the seal of the ring sent thee is a Pentalpha.\"\n\n                                   [Image]\n\n6. And I Solomon was overjoyed, and praised and glorified the God of heaven\nand earth. And on the morrow I called the boy, and gave him the ring, and\nsaid to him: \"take this, and at the hour in which the demon shall come unto\nthee, throw this ring at the chest of the demon, and say to him: 'In the\nname of God, King Solomon calls thee hither.' And then do thou come running\nto me, without having any misgivings or fear in respect of aught thou mayest\nhear on the part of the demon.\"\n\n7. So the child took the ring, and went off; and behold, at the [17]\ncustomary hour Ornias, the fierce demon, came like a burning fire to take\nthe pay from the child. But the child according to the instructions received\nfrom the king, threw the ring at the chest of the demon, and said: \"King\nSolomon calls thee hither.\" And then he went off at a run to the king. But\nthe demon cried out aloud, saying: \"Child, why hast thou done this to me?\nTake the ring off me, and I will render to thee the gold of the earth. Only\ntake this off me, and forbear to lead me away to Solomon.\"\n\n8. But the child said to the demon: \"As the Lord God of Israel liveth, I\nwill not brook thee. So come hither.\" And the child came at a run,\nrejoicing, to the king, and said: \"I have brought the demon, O king, as thou\ndidst command me, O my master. And behold, he stands before the gates of the\ncourt of thy palace, crying out, and supplicating with a loud voice;\noffering me the silver and gold of the earth if I will only bring him unto\nthee.\"\n\n9. And when Solomon heard this, he rose up from his throne, and went outside\ninto the vestibule of the court of his palace; and there he saw the demon,\nshuddering and trembling. And he said to him: \"Who art thou?\" And the demon\nanswered: \"I am called Ornias.\"\n\n10. And Solomon said to him: \"Tell me, O demon, to what zodiacal sign thou\nart subject.\" And he answered: \"To thw Water-pourer. And those who are\nconsumed with desire for the noble virgins upon earth . . . . . [there\nappears to be a lacuna here], these I strangle. But in case there is no\ndisposition to sleep, I am changed into three forms. Whenever men come to be\nenamoured of women, I metamorphose myself into a comely female; and I take\nhold of the men in their sleep, and play with them. And after a while I\nagain take to my wings, and hie me to the heavenly regions. I also appear as\na lion, and I am commanded by all the demons. I am offspring of the\narchangel Uriel, the power of God.\"\n\n11. I Solomon, having heard the name of the archangel, prayed and glorified\nGod, the Lord of heaven and earth. And I sealed the [18] demon and set him\nto work at stone-cutting, so that he might cut the stones in the Temple,\nwhich, lying along the shore, had been brought by the Sea of Arabia. But he,\nfearful of the iron, continued and said to me: \"I pray thee, King Solomon,\nlet me go free; and I will bring you all the demons.\" And as he was not\nwilling to be subject to me, I prayed the archangel Uriel to come and\nsuccour me; and I forthwith beheld the archangel Uriel coming down to me\nfrom the heavens.\n\n12. And the angel bade the whales of the sea come out of the abyss. And he\ncast his destiny upon the ground, and that [destiny] made subject [to him]\nthe great demon. And he commanded the great demon and bold Ornias, to cut\nstones at the Temple. And accordingly I Solomon glorified the God of heaven\nand Maker of the earth. And he bade Ornias come with his destiny, and gave\nhim the seal, saying: \"Away with thee, and bring me hither the prince of all\nthe demons.\"\n\n13. So Ornias took the finger-ring, and went off to Beelzeboul, who has\nkingship over the demons. He said to him: \"Hither! Solomon calls thee.\" But\nBeelzeboul, having heard, said to him: \"Tell me, who is this Solomon of whom\nthou speakest to me?\" Then Ornias threw the ring at the chest of Beelzeboul,\nsaying: \"Solomon the king calls thee.\" But Beelzeboul cried aloud with a\nmighty voice, and shot out a great burning flame of fire; and he arose, and\nfollowed Ornias, and came to Solomon.\n\n14. And when I saw the prince of demons, I glorified the Lord God, Maker of\nheaven and earth, and I said: \"Blessed art thou, Lord God Almighty, who hast\ngiven to Solomon thy servant wisdom, the assessor of the wise, and hast\nsubjected unto me all the power of he devil.\"\n\n15. And I questioned him, and said: \"Who art thou?\" The demon replied: \"I am\nBeelzebub, the exarch of the demons. And all [19] the demons have their\nchief seats close to me. And I it is who make manifest the apparition of\neach demon.\" And he promised to bring to me in bonds all the unclean\nspirits. And I again glorified the God of heaven and earth, as I do always\ngive thanks to him.\n\n16. I then asked of the demon if there were females among them. And when he\ntold me that there were, I said that I desired to see them. So Beelzeboul\nwent off at high speed, and brought unto me Onoskelis, that had a very\npretty shape, and the skin of a fair-hued woman; and she tossed her head.\n\n17. And when she was come, I said to her: \"Tell me who art thou?'' But she\nsaid to me: \"I am called Onoskelis, a spirit wrought ...[?shabtai/Saturn?],\nlurking upon the earth. There is a golden cave where I lie. But I have a\nplace that ever shifts. At one time I strangle men with a noose; at another,\nI creep up from the nature to the arms [in marg: \"worms\"]. But my most\nfrequent dwelling-places are the precipices, caves, ravines. Oftentimes,\nhowever, do I consort with men in the semblance of a woman, and above all\nwith those of a dark skin. For they share my star with me; since they it is\nwho privily or openly worship my star, without knowing that they harm\nthemselves, and but whet my appetite for further mischief. For they wish to\nprovide money by means of memory (commemoration?), but I supply a little to\nthose who worship me fairly.\"\n\n18. And I Solomon questioned her about her birth, and she replied: \"I was\nborn of a voice untimely, the so-called echo of a man's ordure [1] dropped\nin a wood.\"\n\n     [1. For the demon born of an echo we have an analogue in the\n     Hebrew Bath Kol, \"the daughter of a voice.\" In the Gnostic Hymn to\n     Hermes, edited by Dieterich, Abrasax, p 19, we read, l. 104...]\n\n19. And I said to her: \"Under what star dost thou pass?\" And she answered\nme: \"Under the star of the full moon, for the reason that the moon travels\nover most things.\" Then I said to her: \"And [20] what angel is it that\nfrustrates thee?\" And she said to me: \"He that in thee [or \"through thee\" is\nreigning.\" And I thought that she mocked me, and bade a soldier strike her.\nBut she cried aloud, and said: \"I am [subjected] to thee, O king, by the\nwisdom of God given to thee, and by the angel Joel.\"\n\n20. So I commanded her to spin the hemp for the ropes used in the building\nof the house of God; and accordingly, when I had sealed and bound her, she\nwas so overcome and brought to naught as to stand night and day spinning the\nhemp.\n\n21. And I at once bade another demon to be led unto me; and instantly there\napproached me the demon Asmodeus, bound, and I asked him: \"Who art thou ?''\nBut he shot on me a glance of anger and rage, and said: \"And who art thou?''\nAnd I said to him: \"Thus punished as thou art, answerest thou me?\" But he,\nwith rage, said to me: \"But how shall I answer thee, for thou art a son of\nman; whereas I was born an angel's seed by a daughter of man, so that no\nword of our heavenly kind addressed to the earth-born can be overweening.\nWherefore also my star is bright in heaven, and men call it, some the Wain,\nand some the dragon's child. I keep near unto this star. So ask me not many\nthings; for thy kingdom also after a little time is to be disrupted, and thy\nglory is but for a season. And short will be thy tyranny over us; and then\nwe shall again have free range over mankind, so as that they shall revere us\nas if we were gods, not knowing, men that they are, the names of the angels\nset over us.\"\n\n22. And I Solomon, on hearing this, bound him more carefully, and ordered\nhim to be flogged with thongs of ox-hide, and to tell me humbly what was his\nname and what his business. And he answered me thus: \"I am called Asmodeus\namong mortals, and my business is to plot against the newly wedded, so that\nthey may not know one another. And I sever them utterly by many calamities,\nand I waste away the beauty of virgin women, and estrange their hearts.\"\n\n23. And I said to him: \"Is this thy only business?\" And he answered me: \"I\ntransport men into fits of madness and desire, when they have wives of their\nown, so that they leave them, and go off by [21] night and day to others\nthat belong to other men; with the result that they commit sin, and fall\ninto murderous deeds.\"\n\n24. And I adjured him by the name of the Lord Saba�th, saying: \"Fear God,\nAsmodeus, and tell me by what angel thou art frustrated.\" But he said: \"By\nRaphael, the archangel that stands before the throne of God. But the liver\nand gall of a fish put me to flight, when smoked over ashes of the\ntamarisk.\" I again asked him, and said: \"Hide not aught from me. For I am\nSolomon, son of David, King of Israel. Tell me the name of the fish which\nthou reverest.\" And he answered: \"It is the Glanos by name, and is found in\nthe rivers of Assyria; wherefore it is that I roam about in those parts.\"\n\n25. And I said to him: \"Hast thou nothing else about thee, Asmodeus?\" And he\nanswered: \"The power of God knoweth, which hath bound me with the\nindissoluble bonds of yonder one's seal, that whatever I have told thee is\ntrue. I pray thee, King Solomon, condemn me not to [go into] water.\" But I\nsmiled, and said to him: \"As the Lord God of my fathers liveth, I will lay\niron on thee to wear. But thou shalt also make the clay for the entire\nconstruction of the Temple, treading it down with thy feet.\" And I ordered\nthem to give him ten water-jars to carry water in. And the demon groaned\nterribly, and did the work I ordered him to do. And this I did, because that\nfierce demon Asmodeus knew even the future. And I Solomon glorified God, who\ngave wisdom to me Solomon his servant. And the liver of the fish and its\ngall I hung on the spike of a reed, and burned it over Asmodeus because of\nhis being so strong, and his unbearable malice was thus frustrated.\n\n26. And I summoned again to stand before me Beelzeboul, the prince of\ndemons, and I sat him down on a raised seat of honour, and said to him: \"Why\nart thou alone, prince of the demons?\" And he said to me: \"Because I alone\nam left of the angels of heaven that came down. For I was first angel in the\nfirst heaven being entitled Beelzeboul. And now I control all those who are\nbound in Tartarus. But I too have a child, and he haunts the Red Sea. And on\nany suitable occasion he comes up to me again, being subject to me; and\nreveals to me what he has done, and I support him.\n[22]\n\n27. I Solomon said unto him: \"Beelzeboul, what is thy employment?\" And he\nanswered me: \"I destroy kings. I ally myself with foreign tyrants. And my\nown demons I set on to men, in order that the latter may believe in them and\nbe lost. And the chosen servants of God, priests and faithful men, I excite\nunto desires for wicked sins, and evil heresies, and lawless deeds; and they\nobey me, and I bear them on to destruction. And I inspire men with envy, and\n[desire for] murder, and for wars and sodomy, and other evil things. And I\nwill destroy the world.\"\n\n28. So I said to him: \"Bring to me thy child, who is, as thou sayest, in the\nRed Sea.\" But he said to me: \"I will not bring him to thee. But there shall\ncome to me another demon called Ephippas. Him will I bind, and he will bring\nhim up from the deep unto me.\" And I said to him: \"How comes thy son to be\nin the depth of the sea, and what is his name? \"And he answered me: \"Ask me\nnot, for thou canst not learn from me. However, he will come to thee by any\ncommand, and will tell thee openly.\"\n\n29. I said to him: \"Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated.\" And he\nanswered: \"By the holy and precious name of the Almighty God, called by the\nHebrews by a row of numbers, of which the sum is 644, and among the Greeks\nit is Emmanuel [1]. And if one of the Romans adjure me by the great name of\nthe power Ele�th, I disappear at once.\"\n\n     [1. The text must be faulty, for the word Emmanuel is the Hebrew.\n     The sum 644 is got by adding together the Greek numbers.]\n\n30. I Solomon was astounded when I heard this; and I ordered him to saw up\nTheban [1] marbles. And when he began to saw the marbles, the other demons\ncried out with a loud voice, howling because of their king Beelzeboul.\n\n     [1. We hear of Pentelic marble in Strabo, but the reference in the\n     text may be to Thebes in Egypt.]\n\n31. But I Solomon questioned him, saying: \"If thou wouldst gain a respite,\ndiscourse to me about the things in heaven.\" And Beelzeboul said: \"Hear, O\nking, if thou burn gum, and incense, and bulb of the sea [1], with nard and\nsaffron, and light seven lamps in an earthquake [2], thou wilt firmly fix\nthy house. And if, being pure [3], [23] thou light them at dawn in the sun\nalight, then wilt thou see the heavenly dragons, how they wind themselves\nalong and drag the chariot of the sun.\"\n\n     [1. Perhaps the \"sea-bulbs\" were the balls of hair-like texture\n     which the sea washes up on Mediterranean shores, e.g. in Tunisia.\n\n     2. Perhaps \"in a row,\" should be read.\n\n     3. For the condition here insisted on cp. Dieterich, Abrasax, p.\n     141, where in an incantation ceremonial purity is similarly\n     insisted on. The ritual of a magic papyrus given by Dieterich, p.\n     169, is very similar to that here prescribed in the Testament.]\n\n32. And I Solomon, having heard this, rebuked him, and said: \"Silence for\nthis present [1], and continue to saw the marbles as I commanded thee.\" And\nI Solomon praised God, and commanded another demon to present himself to me.\nAnd one came before me who carried his face high up in the air, but the rest\nof the spirit curled away like a snail. And it broke through the few\nsoldiers, and raised also a terrible dust on the ground, and carried it\nupwards; and then again hurled it back to frighten us, and asked what\nquestions I could ask as a rule. And I stood up, and spat [2] on the ground\nin that spot, and sealed with the ring of God. And forthwith the dust-wind\nstopped. Then I asked him, saying: \"Who art thou, O wind?\" Then he once more\nshook up a dust, and answered me: \"What wouldst thou have, King Solomon?\" I\nanswered him: \"Tell me what thou art called, and I would fain ask thee a\nquestion. But so far I give thanks to God who has made me wise to answer\ntheir evil plots.\"\n\n     [1. So Luke xxii. 51.\n\n     2. For the use of spittle to produce a cure or other effect in a\n     magical way, cp. Mark vii. 33 and viii. 23. In John ix. 6, Jesus,\n     we read, \"spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and\n     anointed the eyes with the clay.\" Of this magic use of spittle\n     Pliny, in his Natural History, gives numerous examples. It was\n     common in antiquity.]\n\n33. But [the demon] answered me: \"I am the spirit of the ashes (Tephras).\"\nAnd I said to him: \"What is thy pursuit?\" And he said: \"I bring darkness on\nmen, and set fire to fields; and I bring homesteads to naught. But most busy\nam I in summer. However, when I get an opportunity, I creep into corners of\nthe wall, by night and day. For I am offspring of the great one, and nothing\nless.\" Accordingly I said to him: \"Under what star dost thou lie?\" And he\nanswered: \"In the very tip of the moon's horn, when it is found in the\nsouth. There is my star. For I have been bidden to restrain the convulsions\nof the hemitertian fever; and this is why many men pray to the hemitertian\nfever, using these three names: Bultala, Thallal, [24] Melchal. And I heal\nthem.\" And I said to him: \"I am Solomon; when therefore thou wouldst do\nharm, by whose aid dost thou do it?\" But he said to me: \"By the angel's, by\nwhom also the third day's fever is lulled to rest.\" So I questioned him, and\nsaid: \"And by what name [1]?\" And he answered: \"That of the archangel\nAzael.\" And I summoned the archangel Azael, and set a seal on the demon, and\ncommanded him to seize great stones, and toss them up to the workmen on the\nhigher parts of the Temple. And, being compelled, the demon began to do what\nhe was bidden to do.\n\n     [1. Cp. Acts iv. 7.]\n\n34. And I glorified God afresh who gave me this authority, and ordered\nanother demon to come before me. And there came seven spirits [1], females,\nbound and woven together, fair in appearance and comely. And I Solomon,\nseeing them, questioned them and said: \"Who are ye?\" But they, with one\naccord, said with one voice [2]: \"We are of the thirty-three elements of the\ncosmic ruler of the darkness [3].\" And the first said: \"I am Deception.\" The\nsecond said: \"I am Strife.\" The third: \"I am Klothod, which is battle.\" The\nfourth: \"I am Jealousy.\" The fifth: \"I am Power.\" The sixth: \"I am Error.\"\nThe seventh: \"I am the worst of all, and our stars are in heaven. Seven\nstars humble in sheen, and all together. And we are called as it were\ngoddesses. We change our place all and together, and together we live,\nsometimes in Lydia, sometimes in Olympus, sometimes in a great mountain.\"\n\n     [1. The Pleiades seem to be referred to. Cp. Job xxxviii. 31, in\n     the Revised Version: \"Canst thou bind the cluster of the\n     Pleiades?\" They had a malign influence. The grouping of evil\n     spirits by sevens is common in Babylonian and Jewish folk-lore. As\n     examples I may cite the Testamentum of Reuben, ch. 2, and the\n     seven evil spirits of the N.T. Possibly, however, the Seven\n     Planets are here in question; though this is unlikely, for they do\n     not tally with the description given.\n\n     2. Rom. xv. 6 has the same phrase. For \"thirty-three\" we should\n     read \"thirty-six\" elements. Note that later in the Testament these\n     seven spirits are not among the Kosmokrators, a proof that the\n     document before us is a composite one.\n\n     3. Paul speaks of the Kosmokrators in Eph. vi. 12: \"Our wrestling\n     is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities,\n     against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness.\"\n     See Iren. Haer. I. i. 10.]\n\n35. So I Solomon questioned them one by one, beginning with the first, and\ngoing down to the seventh. The first said: \"I am Deception, I deceive and\nweave snares here and there. I whet and excite heresies. But I have an angel\nwho frustrates me, Lamechalal.\"\n[25]\n\n36. Likewise also the second said: \"I am Strife, strife of strifes. I bring\ntimbers, stones, hangers, my weapons on the spot. But I have an angel who\nfrustrates me, Baruchiachel.\"\n\n37. Likewise also the third said: \"I am called Klothod [1], which is Battle,\nand I cause the well-behaved to scatter and fall foul one of the other. And\nwhy do I say so much? I have an angel that frustrates me: \"Marmarath.\"\n\n     [1. Fabricius, Cod. Pseudepigr. V.T. vol. I, p. 1047, reads\n     Klothon, which must be i.q. Kludun, which Hesychius explains thus:\n     ...]\n\n38. Likewise also the fourth said: \"I cause men to forget their sobriety and\nmoderation. I part them and split them into parties; for Strife follows me\nhand in hand. I rend the husband from the sharer of his bed, and children\nfrom parents, and brothers from sisters. But why tell so much to my despite?\nI have an angel that frustrates me, the great Balthial.\"\n\n39. Likewise also the fifth said: \"I am Power. By power I raise up tyrants\nand tear down kings. To all rebels I furnish power. I have an angel that\nfrustrates me, Astera�th.\"\n\n40. Likewise also the sixth said: \"I am Error [1], O King Solomon. And I\nwill make thee to err, as I have before made thee to err, when I caused thee\nto slay thy own brother [2]. I will lead you into error, so as to pry into\ngraves [3]; and 1 teach them that dig, and I lead errant souls away from all\npiety, and many other evil traits are mine. But I have an angel that\nfrustrates me, Uriel.\"\n\n     [1. Cp. Testam. of Symeon, ch. 3.\n\n     2. See I Kings ii. 25.\n\n     3. A reference to necromancy, of which the object was to oblige\n     the spirit of the dead to enter oneself.]\n\n41. Likewise also the seventh said: \"I am the worst, and I make thee worse\noff than thou wast; because I will impose the bonds of Artemis. But the\nlocust [1] will set me free, for by means thereof is it fated that thou\nshalt achieve my desire . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . For if one were\nwise, he would not turn his steps toward me.\"\n\n     [1. This refers to the closing incident narrated in the Testament,\n     the sacrificing by Solomon of five locusts to Moloch. Tatian,\n     Orat. ad Graecos, cap. 12, speaks of Artemis magos. She is the\n     same as Hecate.]\n\n42. So I Solomon, having heard and wondered, sealed them with my ring; and\nsince they were so considerable, I bade them dig the foundations of the\nTemple of God. For the length of it was 250 cubits. And I bade them be\nindustrious, and with one murmur of joint protest they began to perform the\ntasks enjoined.\n[26]\n\n43. But I Solomon glorified the Lord, and bade another demon come before me.\nAnd there was brought to me a demon having all the limbs of a man, but\nwithout a head. And I, seeing him, said to him: \"Tell me, who art thou?''\nAnd he answered: \"I am a demon.\" So I said to him: \"Which?\" And he answered\nme: \"I am called Envy. For I delight to devour heads, being desirous to\nsecure for myself a head; but I do not eat enough, but am anxious to have\nsuch a head as thou hast.\"\n\n44. I Solomon, on hearing this, sealed him, stretching out my hand against\nhis chest. Whereon the demon leapt up, and threw himself down, and gave a\ngroan, saying: \"Woe is me! where am I come to? O traitor Ornias, I cannot\nsee!\" So I said to him: \"I am Solomon. Tell me then how thou dost manage to\nsee.\" And he answered me: \"By means of my feelings.\" I then, Solomon, having\nheard his voice come up to me, asked him how he managed to speak. And he\nanswered me: \"I, O King Solomon, am wholly voice, for I have inherited the\nvoices of many men. For in the case of all men who are called dumb, I it is\nwho smashed their heads, when they were children and had reached their\neighth day. Then when a child is crying in the night, I become a spirit, and\nglide by means of his voice. . . . In the crossways [1] also I have many\nservices to render, and my encounter is fraught with harm. For I grasp in\nall instant a man's head, and with my hands, as with a sword, I cut it off,\nand put it on to myself. And in this way, by means of the fire which is in\nme, through my neck it is swallowed up. I it is that sends grave mutilations\nand incurable on men's feet, and inflict sores.\"\n\n     [1. This seems the sense of enodiais, unless understood,\n     trivialibus dis, \"to the demons of the wayside or cross-road.\"\n     Hecate was such a goddess, and in C.I. 26 we have mention of a\n     daimon enodia, the Latin Trivia. As a subst. the neut. plur.\n     enodia: = blisters caused by walking, in Theophr, Sud. 15.]\n\n45. And I Solomon, on hearing this, said to him: \"Tell me how thou dost\ndischarge forth the fire? Out of what sources dost thou emit it?\" And the\nspirit said to me: \"From the Day-star [1]. For here hath not yet been found\nthat Elburion, to whom men offer prayers and kindle lights. And his name is\ninvoked by the seven demons before me. And he cherishes them.\"\n\n     [1. Or, \"from the Orient.\"]\n\n46. But I said to him: \"Tell me his name.\" But he answered: \"I cannot tell\nthee. For if I tell his name, I render myself incurable. But he will come in\nresponse to his name.\" And on hearing this, I Solomon said to him: \"Tell me\nthen, by what angel thou art frustrated?\" And he answered: \"By the fiery\nflash of lightning.\" [27] And I bowed myself before the Lord God of Israel,\nand bade him remain in the keeping of Beelzeboul until Iax [1] should come.\n\n     [1. Bornemann conjectures \"a guardian or watcher.\" But the angel\n     Iax recurs below in # 86.]\n\n47. Then I ordered another demon to come before me, and there came into my\npresence a hound, having a very large shape, and it spoke with a loud voice,\nand said, \"Hail, Lord, King Solomon!\" And I Solomon was astounded. I said to\nit: Who art thou, O hound?\" And it answered: \"I do indeed seem to thee to be\na hound, but before thou wast, O King Solomon, I was a man that wrought many\nunholy deeds on earth. I was surpassingly learned in letters, and was so\nmighty that I could hold the stars of heaven back. And many divine works did\nI prepare. For I do harm to men who follow after our star, and turn them to\n. . . . [1] And I seize the frenzied men by the larynx, and so destroy\nthem.\"\n\n     [1. The MS. has a vox nihili. Can it mean \"her that is born of\n     echo\" (see above, p. 19, n. 8).?]\n\n48. And I Solomon said to him: \"What is thy name?\" And he answered: ''Staff\"\n(Rabdos). And I said to him: \"What is thine employment? And what results\ncanst thou achieve?\" And he replied: ''Give me thy man, and I will lead him\naway into a mountainous spot, and will show him a green stone tossed to and\nfro, with which thou mayest adorn the temple of the Lord God.\"\n\n49. And I Solomon, on hearing this, ordered my servant to set off with him,\nand to take the finger-ring bearing the seal of God with him. And I said to\nhim: \"Whoever shall show thee the green stone, seal him with this\nfinger-ring. And mark the spot with care, and bring me the demon hither. And\nthe demon showed him the green stone, and he sealed it, and brought the\ndemon to me. And I Solomon decided to confine with my seal on my right hand\nthe two, the headless demon, likewise the hound, that was so huge [1]; he\nshould be bound as well. And I bade the hound keep safe the fiery spirit so\nthat lamps as it were might by day and night cast their light through its\nmaw on the artisans at work.\n\n     [1. The text seems corrupt here.]\n\n50. And I Solomon took from the mine of that stone 200 shekels for the\nsupports of the table of incense, which was similar in appearance. And I\nSolomon glorified the Lord God, and then closed round the treasure of that\nstone. And I ordered afresh the demons to cut marble for the construction of\nthe house of God. And I Solomon prayed to the Lord, and asked the hound,\nsaying: \"By what angel [28] art thou frustrated?\" And the demon replied: \"By\nthe great Brieus [1].\"\n\n     [1. Briareus is suggested by Bornemann as the right reading, but\n     with little probability, since Briareus would not have been turned\n     into an angel.]\n\n51. And I praised the Lord God of heaven and earth, and bade another demon\ncome forward to me; and there came before me one in the form of a lion\nroaring. And he stood and answered me saying: \"O king, in the form which I\nhave, I am a spirit quite incapable of being perceived. Upon all men who lie\nprostrate with sickness I leap, coming stealthily along; and I render the\nman weak, so that his habit of body is enfeebled. But I have also another\nglory, O king. I cast out demons, and I have legions under my control. And I\nam capable of being received [1] in my dwelling-places, along with all the\ndemons belonging to the legions under me.\" But I Solomon, on hearing this,\nasked him: \"What is thy name?\" But he answered: \"Lion-bearer, Rath [2] in\nkind.\" And I said to him: \"How art thou to be frustrated along with thy\nlegions? What angel is it that frustrates thee?\" And he answered: \"If I tell\nthee my name, I bind not myself alone, but also the legions of demons under\nme.\"\n\n     [1. dektikos seems here to bear this sense, as also in the\n     fragment of a very old commentary on the Shepherd of Hermas in the\n     Oxyrhynchus papyri. part i, by Grenfell and Hunt, 1898, p. 9. The\n     dwelling-places are the persons of whom the spirit, good or evil,\n     takes possession. So in the Docetic Acta Iohannis (ed. M.R. James)\n     the Christ says: \"I have no dwelling, and I have dwellings; I have\n     no place, and I have places; I have no temple, and I have temples.\n     ... Behold thyself in me who address thee.\"\n\n     2. radinos, \"slender tapering\" is suggested by Bornemann as the\n     true reading, because a \"staff\" might be such.]\n\n52. So I said to him: \"I adjure thee in the name of the God Sabaoth, to tell\nme by what name thou art frustrated along with thy host.\" And the spirit\nanswered me: \"The 'great among men,' who is to suffer many things at the\nhands of men, whose name is the figure 644, which is Emmanuel; he it is who\nhas bound us, and who will then come and plunge us from the steep [1] under\nwater. He is noised abroad in the three letters which bring him down [2].\"\n\n     [1. The allusion is to the swine of Gadara.\n\n     2. The three characters are apparently the numbers 644.]\n\n53. And I Solomon, on hearing this, glorified God, and condemned his legion\nto carry wood from the thicket. And I condemned the [29] lion-shaped one\nhimself to saw up the wood small with his teeth, for burning in the\nunquenchable furnace for the Temple of God.\n\n54. And I worshipped the Lord God of Israel, and bade another demon come\nforward. And there came before me a dragon, three-headed, of fearful hue.\nAnd I questioned him: \"Who art thou?\" And he answered me: \"I am a\ncaltrop-like spirit [1], whose activity in three lines. But I blind children\nin women's wombs, and twirl their ears round. And I make them deaf [2] and\nmute. And I have again in my third head means of slipping in [3]. And I\nsmite men in the limbless part of the body, and cause them to fall down, and\nfoam, and grind their teeth. But I have my own way of being frustrated,\nJerusalem being signified in writing, unto the place called 'of the head\n[4].\" For there is fore-appointed the angel of the great counsel, and now he\nwill openly dwell on the cross. He doth frustrate me, and to him am I\nsubject.\"\n\n     [1. Tribolaios. The tribolos was a three-spiked instrument, thrown\n     on the ground to wound horses' feet.\n\n     2. bub�, an unknown word.\n\n     3. a word of doubtful sense.\n\n     4. i.e. Golgotha. The old legend was that Adam's skull reposed in\n     this spot, and that the cross was planted upon it.]\n\n55. \"But in the place where thou sittest, O King Solomon, standeth a column\nin the air, of purple... [1] The demon called Ephippas hath brought [it] up\nfrom the Red Sea, from inner Arabia. He it is that shall be shut up in a\nskin-bottle and brought before thee. But at the entrance of the Temple,\nwhich thou hast begun to build, O King Solomon, lies stored much gold, which\ndig thou up and carry off.\" And I Solomon sent my servant, and found it to\nbe as the demon told me. And I sealed him with my ring, and praised the Lord\nGod.\"\n\n     [1. The meaning of the last part of this compound is unknown.]\n\n56. So I said to him: \"What art thou called?\" And the demon said: \"I am the\ncrest of dragons.\" And I bade him make bricks in the Temple. He had human\nhands.\n\n57. And I adored the Lord God of Israel, and bade another demon present\nhimself. And there came before me a spirit in woman's form, that had a head\nwithout any limbs [1], and her hair was dishevelled. And I said to her: \"Who\nart thou?\" But she answered: \"Nay, who art thou? And why dost thou want to\nhear concerning me? But, as thou wouldst learn, here I stand bound before\nthy face. Go [30] then into thy royal storehouses and wash thy hands. Then\nsit down afresh before thy tribunal, and ask me questions; and thou shalt\nlearn, O king, who I am.\"\n\n     [1. Here we seem to have the Greek head of Medusa transformed into\n     a demon.]\n\n58. And I Solomon did as she enjoined me, and restrained myself because of\nthe wisdom dwelling in me [1]; in order that I might hear of her deeds, and\nreprehend them, and manifest them to men. And I sat down, and said to the\ndemon: \"What art thou?\" And she said: \"I am called among men Obizuth; and by\nnight I sleep not, but go my rounds over all the world, and visit women in\nchildbirth. And divining the hour I take my stand [2]; and if I am lucky, I\nstrangle the child. But if not, I retire to another place. For I cannot for\na single night retire unsuccessful. For I am a fierce [3] spirit, of myriad\nnames and many shapes. And now hither, now thither I roam. And to westering\nparts I go my rounds. But as it now is, though thou hast sealed me round\nwith the ring of God, thou hast done nothing. I am not standing before thee,\nand thou wilt not be able to command me. For I have no work other than the\ndestruction of children, and the making their ears to be deaf, and the\nworking of evil to their eyes, and the binding their mouths with a bond, and\nthe ruin of their minds, and paining of their bodies.\"\n\n     [1. The Sophia, identified by Philo and the early Fathers with the\n     Logos, is supposed to have entered into and taken possession of\n     Solomon as it afterwards did with Jesus.\n\n     2. stamatihu, an unknown verb.\n\n     3. xalep�n.]\n\n59. When I Solomon heard this, I marvelled at her appearance, for I beheld\nall her body to be in darkness. But her glance was altogether bright and\ngreeny, and her hair was tossed wildly like a dragon's; and the whole of her\nlimbs were invisible. And her voice was very clear as it came to me. And I\ncunningly said: \"Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated, O evil spirit?\"\nBy she answered me: \"By the angel of God called Afar�t, which is interpreted\nRaphael, by whom I am frustrated now and for all time. His name, if any man\nknow it, and write the same on a woman in childbirth, then I shall not be\nable to enter her. Of this name the number is 640 [1].\" And I Solomon having\nheard this, and having glorified the Lord, ordered her hair to be bound, and\nthat she should be hung up in front of the Temple of God; that all the\nchildren of Israel, as they passed, might see it, and glorify the Lord God\nof Israel, who had given me this authority, with wisdom and power from God,\nby means of this signet.\n\n     [1. Bornemann (Zeitschr. f.d. Hist. Theol. 1844, p. 38) gives the\n     tale of figures. r = 100; a = 1; f = 500; a = 1; m = 8; l = 30.\n     Total 640.]\n\n[31]\n\n60. And I again ordered another demon to come before me. And the came,\nrolling itself along, one in appearance like to a dragon, but having the\nface and hands of a man. And all its limbs, except the feet, were those of a\ndragon; and it had wings on its back. And when I beheld it, I was astonied,\nand said: \"Who art thou, demon, and what art thou called? And whence hast\nthou come? Tell me.\"\n\n61. And the spirit answered and said: \"This is the first time I have stood\nbefore the, O King Solomon. I am a spirit made into a god among men, but now\nbrought to naught by the ring and wisdom vouchsafed to thee by God. Now I am\nthe so-called winged dragon [1], and I chamber not with many women, but only\nwith a few that are of fair shape, which possess the name of xuli, of this\nstar. And I pair with them in the guise of a spirit winged in form, coitum\nhabens per nates. And she on whom I have leapt goes heavy with child, and\nthat which is born of her becomes eros. But since such offspring cannot be\ncarried by men, the woman in question breaks wind. Such is my role. Supposed\nthen only that I am satisfied, and all the other demons molested and\ndisturbed by thee will speak the whole truth. But those composed of fire [2]\nwill cause to be burned up by fire the material of the logs which is to be\ncollected by them for the building in the Temple.\"\n\n     [1. pterodr�kun, a word not in the lexicons.\n\n     2. T� d� di� pyr�s.]\n\n62. And as the demon said this, I saw the spirit going forth from his mouth,\nand it consumed the wood of the frankincense-tree, and burned up all the\nlogs which we had placed in the Temple of God. And I Solomon saw what the\nspirit had done, and I marvelled.\n\n63. And, having glorified God, I asked the dragon-shaped demon, and said:\n\"Tell me, by what angel art thou frustrated?\" And he answered: \"By the great\nangel which has its seat in the second heaven, which is called in Hebrew\nBazazeth. And I Solomon, having heard this, and having invoked his angel,\ncondemned him to saw up marbles for the building of the Temple of God; and I\npraised God, and commanded another demon to come before me.\n\n64. And there came before my face another spirit, as it were a woman in the\nform she had. But on her shoulders she had two other heads with hands. And I\nasked her, and said: \"Tell me, who art thou?\" And she said to me: \"I am\nEn�psigos, who also have a myriad names.\" And I said her: \"By what angel art\nthou frustrated?\" But she said to me: \"What seekest, what askest thou? I\nundergo changes, like the goddess I am called. And I change again, and pass\ninto possession of another shape. And be not [32] desirous therefore to know\nall that concerns me. But since thou art before me for this much, hearken. I\nhave my abode in the moon, and for that reason I possess three forms. At\ntimes I am magically [1] invoked by the wise as Kronos. At other times, in\nconnexion with those who bring me down, I come down and appear in another\nshape. The measure of the element [2] is inexplicable and indefinable, and\nnot to be frustrated. I then, changing into these three forms, come down and\nbecome such as thou seest me; but I am frustrated by the angel Rathanael,\nwho sits in the third heaven. This then is why I speak to thee. Yonder\ntemple cannot contain me.\"\n\n     [1. mageyom�ne.\n\n     2. Perhaps \"the place or size of the heavenly body.\"]\n\n65. I therefore Solomon prayed to my God, and I invoked the angel of whom\nEn�psigos spoke to me, and used my seal. And I sealed her with a triple\nchain, and (placed) beneath her the fastening of the chain. I used the seal\nof God, and the spirit prophesied to me, saying: \"This is what thou, King\nSolomon, doest to us. But after a time thy kingdom shall be broken, and\nagain in season this Temple shall be riven asunder [1]; and all Jerusalem\nshall be undone by the King of the Persians and Medes and Chaldaeans. And\nthe vessels of this Temple, which thou makest, shall be put to servile uses\nof the gods; and along with them all the jars, in which thou dost shut us\nup, shall be broken by the hands of men. And then we shall go forth in great\npower hither and thither, and be disseminated all over the world. And we\nshall lead astray the inhabited world for a long season, until the Son of\nGod is stretched upon the cross. For never before doth arise a king like\nunto him, one frustrating us all, whose mother shall not have contact with\nman. Who else can receive such authority over spirits, except he, whom the\nfirst devil will seek to tempt, but will not prevail over? The number of his\nname is 644 [2], which is Emmanuel. Wherefore, O King Solomon, thy time is\nevil, and thy years short and evil, and to thy servant shall thy kingdom be\ngiven [3].\"\n\n     [1. I conjecture the sense which the word must bear in this\n     context.\n\n     2. xmd.\n\n     3. This prophecy corresponds roughly to the one which Lactantius,\n     Instit. Div. lib. iv. c. 18, quotes from an apocryphal Book of\n     Solomon.]\n\n66. And I Solomon, having heard this, glorified God. And though I marvelled\nat the apology of the demons, I did not credit it until it came true. And I\ndid not believe their words; but when they were [33] realized, then I\nunderstood, and at my death I wrote this Testament to the children of\nIsrael, and gave it to them, so that they might know the powers of the\ndemons and their shapes, and the names of their angels, by which these\nangels are frustrated. And I glorified the Lord God of Israel, and commanded\nthe spirits to be bound with bonds indissoluble.\n\n67. And having praised God, I commanded another spirit to come before me;\nand there came before my face another demon, having in front the shape of a\nhorse, but behind of a fish. And he had a mighty voice, and said to me: \"O\nKing Solomon, I am a fierce spirit of the sea, and I am greedy of gold and\nsilver. I am such a spirit as rounds itself and comes over the expanses of\nthe water of the sea, and I trip up the men who sail thereon. For I round\nmyself into a wave [1], and transform myself, and then throw myself on ships\nand come right in on them. And that is my business, and my way of getting\nhold of money and men. For I take the men, and whirl them round with myself,\nand hurl the men out of the sea. For I am not covetous of men's bodies, but\ncast them up out of the sea so far. But since Beelzeboul, ruler of the\nspirits of air and of those under the earth, and lord of earthly ones, hath\na joint kingship with us in respect of the deeds of each one of us,\ntherefore I went up from the sea, to get a certain outlook [2] in his\ncompany.\n\n     [1. Cp. Jude 13. That Jude here indulges in no mere metaphor is\n     clear from the words which follow, which embody the belief\n     detailed in the Testament of Solomon, p. 40.\n\n     2. \"descent, or spiritual assault.\"]\n\n68. \"But I also have another character and role. I metamorphose myself into\nwaves, and come up from the sea. And I show myself to men, so that those on\nearth call me Kuno[s]paston [1], because I assume the human form. And my\nname is a true one. For by my passage up into men, I send forth a certain\nnausea. I came then to take counsel with the prince Beelzeboul; and he bound\nme and delivered me into thy hands. And I am here before thee because of\nthis seal, and thou dost now torment me [2]. Behold now, in two or three\ndays the spirit that converseth with thee will fail, because I shall have no\nwater.\"\n\n     [1. Cf. Pliny, Nat. Hist. 24. 74 \"Cynosbaton, alii Cynospaston,\n     alii neurospaston vocant; folium habet vestigio hominis simile.\n     Fert et uvam nigram, in cuius acino nervum habet, unde\n     neurospastos dicitur.\" The human form revealed itself in the\n     footstep, which the leaf resembled.\n\n     2. basan�xeis. Cp. Matt. viii. 6, 29; xiv. 24; Mark v. 7.]\n\n69. And I said to him: \"Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated.\" [34] And\nhe answered: \"By Iameth.\" And I glorified God. I commanded the spirit to be\nthrown into a phial along with ten jugs of sea-water of two measures each\n[1]. And I sealed them round above the marbles and asphalt and pitch in the\nmouth of the vessel. And having sealed it with my ring, I ordered it to be\ndeposited in the Temple of God. And I ordered another spirit to come before\nme.\n\n     [1. Cp. John ii. 6.]\n\n70. And there came before my face another enslaved spirit, having obscurely\nthe form of a man, with gleaming eyes, and bearing in his hand a blade. And\nI asked: \"Who art thou? But he answered: \"I am a lascivious spirit,\nengendered of a giant man who dies in the massacre in the time of the\ngiants.\" I said to him: \"Tell me what thou art employed on upon earth, and\nwhere thou hast thy dwelling.\"\n\n71. And he said: \"My dwelling is in fruitful places, but my procedure is\nthis. I seat myself beside the men who pass along among the tombs, and in\nuntimely season I assume the form of the dead; and if I catch any one, I at\nonce destroy him with my sword. But if I cannot destroy him, I cause him to\nbe possessed with a demon, and to devour his own flesh, and the hair to fall\noff his chin.\" But I said to him: \"Do thou then be in fear of the God of\nheaven and of earth, and tell me by angel thou art frustrated.\" And he\nanswered: \"He destroys me who is to become Saviour, a man whose number, if\nany one shall write it on his forehead [1], he will defeat me, and in fear I\nshall quickly retreat. And, indeed, if any one write this sign on him, I\nshall be in fear.\" And I Solomon, on hearing this, and having glorified the\nLord God, shut up this demon like the rest.\n\n     [1. Rev. ix. 4; xiii, 16, 17.]\n\n72. And I commanded another demon to come before me. And there came before\nmy face thirty-six spirits, their heads shapeless like dogs, but in\nthemselves they were human in form; with faces of asses, faces of oxen, and\nfaces of birds. And I Solomon, on hearing and seeing them, wondered, and I\nasked them and said: \"Who are you?\" But they, of one accord with one voice,\nsaid [1]: \"We are the thirty-six elements, the world-rulers [2] of this\ndarkness. But, O King Solomon, thou wilt not wrong us nor imprison us, nor\nlay command on us; but since the Lord God has given thee authority over\nevery spirit, in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, therefore\ndo we also present ourselves before thee like the other spirits, from ram\nand bull, from [35] both twin and crab, lion and virgin, scales and\nscorpion, archer, goat-horned, water-pourer, and fish.\n\n     [1. Acts ii. 1.\n\n     2. kosmokratores. Cp. Paul, Eph. vi. 12; Origen, c. Celsum, viii,\n     58.]\n\n73. Then I Solomon invoked the name of the Lord Sabaoth, and questioned each\nin turn as to what was its character. And I bade each one come forward and\ntell of its actions. Then the first one came forward, and said: \"I am the\nfirst decans of the zodiacal circle, and I am called the ram, and with me\nare these two.\" So I put to them the question: \"Who are ye called?\" The\nfirst said: \"I, O Lord, am called Ruax, and I cause the heads of men to be\nidle, and I pillage their brows. But let me only hear the words, 'Michael,\nimprison Ruax,' and at once I retreat.\"\n\n74. And the second said: \"I am called Barsafael, and I cause those who are\nsubject to my hour to feel the pain of migraine. If only I hear the words,\n'Gabriel, imprison Barsafael,' at once I retreat.\"\n\n75. The third said: \"I am called Ar�tosael. I do harm to eyes, and\ngrievously injure them. Only let me hear the words, 'Uriel, imprison\nAratosael' (sic), at once I retreat . . . . .[1]\"\n\n     [1. There seems to be a lacuna here.]\n\n76. The fifth said: \"I am called Iudal, and I bring about a block in the\nears and deafness of hearing. If I hear, 'Uruel Iudal,' I at once retreat.\"\n\n77. The sixth said: \"I am called Sphendona�l. I cause tumours of the parotid\ngland, and inflammations of the tonsils, and tetanic recurvation [1]. If I\nhear, 'Sabrael, imprison Sphendona�l,' at once I retreat.''\n\n     [1. The Greek medical terms which stand in the Greek text are\n     found in Hippocrates, Galen, and Cuel. Aurel.]\n\n78. And the Seventh said: \"I am called Sphand�r, and I weaken the strength\nof the shoulders, and cause them to tremble; and I paralyze the nerves of\nthe hands, and I break and bruise the bones of the neck. And I, I suck out\nthe marrow. But if I hear the words, 'Ara�l, imprison Sphand�r,' I at once\nretreat.\"\n\n79. And the eight said: \"I am called Belbel. I distort the hearts and minds\nof men. If I hear the words, 'Ara�l, imprison Belbel,' I at once retreat.\"\n\n80. And the ninth said: \"I am called Kurta�l. I send colics in the bowels. I\ninduce pains. If I hear the words, 'Ia�th, imprison Kurta�l,' I at once\nretreat.\"\n\n81. The tenth said: \"I am called Metathiax. I cause the reins to ache. If I\nhear the words, 'Ad�na�l, imprison Metathiax,' I at once retreat.\"\n\n82. The eleventh said: \"I am called Katanikota�l. I create strife [36] and\nwrongs in men's homes, and send on them hard temper. If any one would be at\npeace in his home, let him write on seven leaves of laurel the name of the\nangel that frustrates me, along with these names: Iae, Ie�, sons of Saba�th,\nin the name of the great God let him shut up Katanikota�l. Then let him wash\nthe laurel-leaves in water, and sprinkle his house with the water, from\nwithin to the outside. And at once I retreat.\"\n\n83. The twelfth said: \"I am called Saphathora�l, and I inspire partisanship\nin men, and delight in causing them to stumble. If any one will write on\npaper these names of angels, Iac�, Ieal�, I�elet, Saba�th, Ithoth, Bae, and\nhaving folded it up, wear it round his neck or against his ear, I at once\nretreat and dissipate the drunken fit.\"\n\n84. The thirteenth said: \"I am called Bob�l (sic), and I cause nervous\nillness by my assaults. If I hear the name of the great 'Adona�l, imprison\nBothoth�l,' I at once retreat.\"\n\n85. The fourteenth said: \"I am called Kumeat�l, and I inflict shivering fits\nand torpor. If only I hear the words: 'Z�r��l, imprison Kumenta�l,' I at\nonce retreat.\"\n\n86. The fifteenth said: \"I am called Ro�l�d. I cause cold and frost and pain\nin the stomach.

The seventeenth said: \"I am called Ieropa�l. On the stomach of men I\nsit, and cause convulsions in the bath and in the road; and wherever I be\nfound, or find a man, I throw him down.

The eighteenth said: \"I am called Buldum�ch. I separate wife from\nhusband and bring about a grudge between them.

And I Solomon, when I heard this, glorified the God of heaven and\nearth. And I commanded them to fetch water in the Temple of God. And I\nfurthermore prayed to the Lord God to cause the demons without, that hamper\nhumanity, to be bound and made to approach the Temple of God. Some of these\ndemons I condemned to do the heavy work of the construction of the Temple of\nGod. Others I shut up in prisons. Others I ordered to wrestle with fire in\n(the making of) gold and silver, sitting down by lead and spoon. And to make\nready places for the other demons in which they should be confined.\n\n108. And I Solomon had much quiet in all the earth, and spent my life in\nprofound peace, honoured by all men and by all under heaven. And I built the\nentire Temple of the Lord God. And my kingdom was prosperous, and my army\nwas with me. And for the rest the city of Jerusalem had repose, rejoicing\nand delighted. [39] And all the kings of the earth came to me from the ends\nof the earth to behold the Temple which I builded to the Lord God. And\nhaving heard of the wisdom given to me, they did homage to me in the Temple,\nbringing gold and silver and precious stones, many and divers, and bronze,\nand iron, and lead, and cedar logs. And woods decay not they brought me, for\nthe equipment of the Temple of God.\n\n109. And among them also the queen of the South, being a witch, came in\ngreat concern and bowed low before me to the earth. And having heard my\nwisdom, she glorified the God of Israel, and she made formal trial of all my\nwisdom, of all love in which I instructed her, according to the wisdom\nimparted to me. And all the sons of Israel glorified God.\n\n110. And behold, in those days one of the workmen, of ripe old age, threw\nhimself down before me, and said: \"King Solomon, pity me, because I am old.\"\nSo I bade him stand up, and said: \"Tell me, old man, all you will.\" And he\nanswered: \"I beseech you king, I have an only-born son, and he insults and\nbeats me openly, and plucks out the hair of my head, and threatens me with a\npainful death. Therefore I beseech you avenge me.\n\n111. And I Solomon, on hearing this, felt compunction as I looked at his old\nage; and I bade the child be brought to me. And when he was brought I\nquestioned him whether it were true. And the youth said: \"I was not so\nfilled with madness as to strike my father with my hand. Be kind to me, O\nking. For I have not dared to commit such impiety, poor wretch that I am.\"\nBut I Solomon on hearing this from the youth, exhorted the old man to\nreflect on the matter, and accept his son's apology. However, he would not,\nbut said he would rather let him die. And as the old man would not yield, I\nwas about to pronounce sentence on the youth, when I saw Ornias the demon\nlaughing. I was very angry at the demon's laughing in my presence; and I\nordered my men to remove the other parties, and bring forward Ornias before\nmy tribunal. And when he was brought before me, I said to him: \"Accursed\none, why didst thou look at me and laugh?\" And the demon answered: \"Prithee,\nking, it was not because of thee I laughed, but because of this ill-starred\nold man and the wretched youth, his son. For after three days his son will\ndie untimely; and lo, the old man desires to foully make away with him.\"\n\n112. But I Solomon, having heard this, said to the demon: \"Is that true that\nthou speakest?\" And he answered: \"It is true; O king.\" And I, on hearing\nthat, bade them remove the demon, and that they should again bring before me\nthe old man with his son. I bade them [40] make friends with one another\nagain, and I supplied them with food. And then I told the old man after\nthree days to bring his son again to me here; \"and,\" said I, \"I will attend\nto him.\" And they saluted me, and went their way.\n\n113. And when they were gone I ordered Ornias to be brought forward, and\nsaid to him: \"Tell me how you know this;\" and he answered: \"We demons ascend\ninto the firmament of heaven, and fly about among the stars. And we hear the\nsentences which go forth upon the souls of men, and forthwith we come, and\nwhether by force of influence, or by fire, or by sword, or by some accident,\nwe veil our act of destruction; and if a man does not die by some untimely\ndisaster or by violence, then we demons transform ourselves in such a way as\nto appear to men and be worshipped in our human nature.\"\n\n114. I therefore, having heard this, glorified the Lord God, and again I\nquestioned the demon, saying: \"Tell me how ye can ascend into heaven, being\ndemons, and amidst the stars and holy angels intermingle.\" And he answered:\n\"Just as things are fulfilled in heaven, so also on earth (are fulfilled)\nthe types [1] of all of them. For there are principalities, authorities,\nworld-rulers [2], and we demons fly about in the air; and we hear the voices\nof the heavenly beings, and survey all the powers. And as having no ground\n(basis) on which to alight and rest, we lose strength and fall off like\nleaves from trees. And men seeing us imagine that the stars are falling from\nheaven. But it is not really so, O king; but we fall because of our\nweakness, and because we have nowhere anything to lay hold of; and so we\nfall down like lightnings [3] in the depth of night and suddenly. And we set\ncities in flames and fire the fields. For the stars have firm foundations in\nthe heavens like the sun and the moon.\"\n\n     [1. Cp. Heb. viii. 5.\n\n     2. Cp. Rom. viii. 38.\n\n     3. Luke x. 18: \"I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.\"\n     June 13.]\n\n115. And I Solomon, having heard this, ordered the demon to be guarded for\nfive days. And after the five days I recalled the old man, and was about to\nquestion him. But he came to me in grief and with black face. And I said to\nhim: \"Tell me, old man, where is thy son? And what means this garb?\" And he\nanswered: \"Lo, I am become childless, and sit by my son's grave in despair.\nFor it is already two days that he is dead.\" But I Solomon, on hearing that,\nand knowing that the demon Ornias had told me the truth, glorified the God\nof Israel.\n\n116. And the queen of the South saw all this, and marvelled, [41] glorifying\nthe God of Israel; and she beheld the Temple of the Lord being builded. And\nshe gave a siklos [1] of gold and one hundred myriads of silver and choice\nbronze, and she went into the Temple. And (she beheld) the altar of incense\nand the brazen supports of this altar, and the gems of the lamps flashing\nforth of different colours, and of the lamp-stand of stone, and of emerald,\nand hyacinth, and sapphire; and she beheld the vessels of gold, and silver,\nand bronze, and wood, and the folds of skins dyed red with madder. And she\nsaw the bases of the pillars of the Temple of the Lord. All were of one gold\n... [2] apart from the demons whom I condemned to labour. And there was\npeace in the circle of my kingdom and over all the earth.\n\n     [1. A shekel. Philo has the form s�klos, i. 468. s�glos is the\n     usual spelling in the LXX.\n\n     2. There seems to be here a lacuna in the MS.]\n\n117. And it came to pass, which I was in my kingdom, the King of the\nArabians, Adares, sent me a letter, and the writing of the letter was\nwritten as follows: --\n\n     \"To King Solomon, all hail! Lo, we have heard, and it hath been\n     heard unto all the ends of the earth, concerning the wisdom\n     vouchsafed in thee, and that thou art a man merciful from the\n     Lord. And understanding hath been granted thee over all the\n     spirits of the air, and on earth, and under the earth. Now,\n     forasmuch as there is present in the land of Arabia a spirit of\n     the following kind: at early dawn there begins to blow a certain\n     wind until the third hour. And its blast is harsh and terrible,\n     and it slays man and beast. And no spirit can live upon earth\n     against this demon. I pray thee then, forasmuch as the spirit is a\n     wind, contrive something according to the wisdom given in thee by\n     the Lord thy God, and deign to send a man able to capture it. And\n     behold, King Solomon, I and my people and all my land will serve\n     thee unto death. And all Arabia shall be at peace with thee, if\n     thou wilt perform this act of righteousness for us. Wherefore we\n     pray thee, contemn not our humble prayer, and suffer not to be\n     utterly brought to naught the eparchy subordinated to thy\n     authority. Because we are suppliants, both I and my people and all\n     my land. Farewell to my Lord. All health!\"\n\n118. And I Solomon read this epistle; and I folded it up and gave it to my\npeople, and said to them: \"After seven days shalt thou remind me of this\nepistle. And Jerusalem was built, and the Temple was being completed. And\nthere was a stone [1], the end stone [42] of the corner lying there, great,\nchosen out, one which I desired lay in the head of the corner of the\ncompletion of the Temple. And all the workmen, and all the demons helping\nthem came to the same place to bring up the stone and lay it on the pinnacle\nof the holy Temple, and were not strong enough to stir it, and lay it upon\nthe corner allotted to it. For that stone was exceedingly great and useful\nfor the corner of the Temple.\"\n\n     [1. Cp. I Pet. ii. 6, 7, who combines in the same way Ps. cxviii.\n     22 and Isa. xxviii. 16. Cp. Matt. xxi. 42, Mark xii, 10, Luke xx,\n     17.]\n\n119. And after seven days, being reminded of the epistle of Adares, King of\nArabia, I called my servant and said to him: \"Order thy camel and take for\nthyself a leather flask, and take also this seal. And go away into Arabia to\nthe place in which the evil spirit blows; and there take the flask, and the\nsignet-ring in front of the mouth of the flask, and (hold them) towards the\nblast of the spirit. And when the flask is blown out, thou wilt understand\nthat the demon is (in it). Then hastily tie up the mouth of to flask, and\nseal it securely with the seal-ring, and lay it carefully on the camel and\nbring it me hither. And if on the way it offer thee gold or silver or\ntreasure in return for letting it go, see that thou be not persuaded. But\narrange without using oath to release it. And then if it point out to the\nplaces where are gold or silver, mark the places and seal them with this\nseal. And bring the demon to me. And now depart, and fare thee well.\"\n\n120. Then the youth did as was bidden him. And he ordered his camel, and\nlaid on it a flask, and set off into Arabia. And the men of that region\nwould not believe that he would be able to catch the evil spirit. And when\nit was dawn, the servant stood before the spirit's blast, and laid the flask\non the ground, and the finger-ring on the mouth of the flask. And the demon\nblew through the middle of the finger-ring into the mouth of the flask, and\ngoing in blew out the flask. But the man promptly stood up to it and drew\ntight with his hand the mouth of the flask, in the name of the Lord God of\nSaba�th. And the demon remained within the flask. And after that the youth\nremained in that land three days to make trial. And the spirit no longer\nblew against that city. And all the Arabs knew that he had safely shut in\nthe spirit.\n\n121. Then the youth fastened the flask on the camel, and the Arabs sent him\nforth on his way with much honour and precious gifts, praising and\nmagnifying the God of Israel. But the youth brought in the bag and laid it\nin the middle of the Temple. And on the next day, I King Solomon, went into\nthe Temple of God and sat in deep distress about the stone of the end of the\ncorner. And when [43] I entered the Temple, the flask stood up and walked\naround some seven steps and then fell on its mouth and did homage to me. And\nI marvelled that even along with the bottle the demon still had power and\ncould walk about; and I commanded it to stand up. And the flask stood up,\nand stood on its feet all blown out. And I questioned him, saying: \"Tell me,\nwho art thou?\" And the spirit within said: \"I am the demon called Ephippas,\nthat is in Arabia.\" And I said to him: \"Is this thy name?\" And he answered:\n\"Yes; wheresoever I will, I alight and set fire and do to death.\"\n\n122. And I said to him: \"By what angel art thou frustrated?\" And he\nanswered: \"By the only-ruling God, that hath authority over me even to be\nheard. He that is to be born of a virgin and crucified by the Jews on a\ncross. Whom the angels and archangels worship. He doth frustrate me, and\nenfeeble me of my great strength, which has been given me by my father the\ndevil.\" And I said to him: \"What canst thou do?'' And he answered: ''I am\nable to remove [1] mountains, to overthrow the oaths of kings. I wither\ntrees and make their leaves to fall off.\" And I said to him: \"Canst thou\nraise this stone, and lay it for the beginning of this corner which exists\nin the fair plan of the Temple [2]?'' And he said: \"Not only raise this, O\nking; but also, with the help of the demon who presides over the Red Sea, I\nwill bring up the pillar of air [3], and will stand it where thou wilt in\nJerusalem.''\n\n     [1. Cp. the faith which removes mountains.\n\n     2. Bornemann suggests that the gate of the Temple called Beautiful\n     (Acts iii. 2, 10) is referred to.\n\n     3. I conjecture the sense.]\n\n123. Saying this, I laid stress on him, and the flask became as if depleted\nof air. And I placed it under the stone, and (the spirit) girded himself up,\nand lifted it up top of the flask. And the flask went up the steps, carrying\nthe stone, and laid it down at the end of the entrance of the Temple. And I\nSolomon, beholding the stone raised aloft and placed on a foundation, said:\n\"Truly the Scripture is fulfilled, which says: 'The stone which the builders\nrejected on trial, that same is become the head of the corner.' For this it\nis not mine to grant, but God's, that the demon should be strong enough to\nlift up so great a stone and deposit it in the place I wished.\"\n\n124. And Ephippas led the demon of the Red Sea with the column. And they\nboth took the column and raised it aloft from the earth. And I outwitted\nthese two spirits, so that they could not shake the entire earth in a moment\nof time. And then I sealed round with my [44] ring on this side and that,\nand said: \"Watch.\" And the spirits have remained upholding it until this\nday, for proof of the wisdom vouchsafed to me. And there the pillar was\nhanging of enormous size, in mid air, supported by the winds. And thus the\nspirits appeared underneath, like air, supporting it. And if one looks\nfixedly, the pillar is a little oblique, being supported by the spirits; and\nit is so to day.\n\n125. And I Solomon questioned the other spirit which came up with the pillar\nfrom the depth of the Red Sea. And I said to him: \"Who art thou, and what\ncalls thee? And what is thy business? For I hear many things about thee.''\nAnd the demon answered: \"I, O King Solomon, am called Abezithibod. I am a\ndescendant of the archangel. Once as I sat in the first heaven, of which the\nname is Ameleouth -- I then am a fierce spirit and winged, and with a single\nwing, plotting against every spirit under heaven. I was present when Moses\nwent in before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and I hardened his heart. I am he\nwhom Iannes and Iambres invoked homing [1] with Moses in Egypt. I am he who\nfought against Moses [2] with wonders with signs.\"\n\n     [1. o�koyx�menoi in the MS., a vox nihili. If we had the apocryph\n     of Iannes and Iambres we might understand the reference.\n\n     2. 2 Tim. iii. 8.]\n\n126. I said therefore to him: \"How wast thou found in the Red Sea?\" And he\nanswered: \"In the exodus of the sons of Israel I hardened the heart of\nPharaoh. And I excited his heart and that of his ministers. And I caused\nthem to pursue after the children of Israel. And Pharaoh followed with (me)\nand all the Egyptians. Then I was present there, and we followed together.\nAnd we all came up upon the Red Sea. And it came to pass when the children\nof Israel had crossed over, the water returned and hid all the host of the\nEgyptians and all their might. And I remained in the sea, being kept under\nthis pillar. But when Ephippas came, being sent by thee, shut up in the\nvessel of a flask, he fetched me up to thee.\"\n\n127. I, therefore, Solomon, having heard this, glorified God and adjured the\ndemons not to disobey me, but to remain supporting the pillar. And they both\nsware, saying: \"The Lord thy God liveth, we will not let go this pillar\nuntil the world's end. But on whatever day this stone fall, then shall be\nthe end of the world [1].\"\n\n     [1. This legend of the heavy cornerstone and of the spirits\n     supporting a column in the Temple reappears in the Georgian Acts\n     of Nouna in the fourth century. There it is a huge wooden column\n     that is lifted by spirit-agency, when the king and workmen had\n     failed to move it into place. The spirits support it in the air\n     before letting it sink into its place. These Acts will shortly\n     appear in an English translation by Miss Wardrop in the\n     forthcoming number of the Studie Biblica, Clarendon Press, 1898.]\n\n[45]\n\n128. And I Solomon glorified God, and adorned the Temple of the Lord with\nall fair-seeming. And I was glad in spirit in my kingdom, and there was\npeace in my days. And I took wives of my own from every land, who were\nnumberless. And I marched against the Jebusaeans, and there I saw Jebusaean,\ndaughter of a man: and fell violently in love with her, and desired to take\nher to wife along with my other wives. And I said to their priests: \"Give me\nthe Sonmanites (i.e. Shunammite) to wife [1].\" But the priests of Moloch\nsaid to me: \"If thou lovest this maiden, go in and worship our gods, the\ngreat god Raphan and the god called Moloch.\" I therefore was in fear of the\nglory of God, and did not follow to worship. And I said to them: \"I will not\nworship a strange god. What is this proposal, that ye compel me to do so\nmuch?\" But they said: \". . . . . [2] by our fathers.\"\n\n     [1. Song of Sol. vi. 12.\n\n     2. uthe�s (sic) stands in the MS.; perhaps ta�s thea�s should be\n     read.]\n\n129. And when I answered that I would on no account worship strange gods,\nthey told the maiden not to sleep with me until I complied and sacrificed to\nthe gods. I then was moved, but crafty Eros brought and laid by her for me\nfive grasshoppers, saying: \"Take these grasshoppers, and crush them together\nin the name of the god Moloch; and then will I sleep with you.\" And this I\nactually did. And at once the Spirit of God departed from me, and I became\nweak as well as foolish in my words. And after that I was obliged by her to\nbuild a temple of idols to Baal [1], and to Rapha, and to Moloch, and to the\nother idols.\n\n     [1. Fem. So Rom. xi. 4.]\n\n130. I then, wretch that I am, followed her advice, and the glory of God\nquite departed from me; and my spirit was darkened, and I became the sport\nof idols and demons. Wherefore I wrote out this Testament, that ye who get\npossession of it may pity, and attend to the last things [1], and not to the\nfirst. So that ye may find grace for ever and ever. Amen.\n\n     [1. Cp. Rev. ii. 19.]\n"
