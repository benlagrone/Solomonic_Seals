# MVP Mobile App Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Data Foundation
- Normalize source texts and headers.
- Build `data/source_texts_index.json`.
- Basic search tooling (CLI or small web page).

## Phase 1 — Ritual Flow Prototype (Web)
- Intent selection (health, wealth, power, protection, clarity).
- Suggested readings (source‑linked excerpts).
- Checklist + journaling prompt.
- Simple progress log (local JSON).

## Phase 2 — Mobile MVP (Read + Ritual)
- Port core flow to mobile (React Native or Flutter).
- Offline library for sources + indexed search.
- Ritual checklist + journal entry storage.

## Phase 3 — Refinement
- Tagging system for sources (theme/intent).
- Gentle reminders and scheduling.
- Optional export of ritual logs.

## Phase 4 — Expansion (Post‑MVP)
- Cross‑references and thematic maps.
- Audio or guided reading mode.
- Optional sync across devices.

## Tech Options
- **React Native**: fast iteration, JS ecosystem.
- **Flutter**: strong UI control, single codebase.

## Success Criteria (MVP)
- Users can find and cite texts quickly.
- Ritual flow completion is smooth and repeatable.
- Reflection logs are retained and searchable.
