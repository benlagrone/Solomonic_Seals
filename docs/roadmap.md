# Solomonic Clock Roadmap

Possible future enhancements for layering more context into the visualization:

- Canonical text links: reference the Key of Solomon, Ars Goetia, or Psalms per seal and surface citations in tooltips or side panels.
- Liturgical layer: align planetary days with historic devotions or canonical hours to suggest daily meditations.
- Astro-calendar tie-ins: connect zodiac degrees to equinoxes, decans, or notable astronomical events with short blurbs.
- Mystical commentary: curate quotes from grimoires, Sufi cosmology, or Kabbalistic texts and display them when a seal is active.
- Ritual hooks: list recommended intentions, incense, or planetary hour guidance for practical timing.
- Symbol imagery: link each seal to sigil artwork or planetary glyphs to show thumbnails on hover.
- Calendar integrations: generate optional `.ics` events for planetary days or spirit transitions that users can import.
- Historical timeline: annotate the yearly ring with publication dates, festivals, or related milestones.
- Guided meditations: attach audio or text prompts keyed to the active spirit or planet for reflection sessions.
- Comparative mythology: map seals to cross-cultural equivalents (e.g., Greek, Mesopotamian) for broader study notes.
