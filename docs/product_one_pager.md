# Solomonic Clock Companion — Product One‑Pager

## Purpose
Create a contemplative companion that grounds Solomonic practice in source‑faithful texts, reflective structure, and practical follow‑through.

## Why
- Curiosity: preserve and explore the corpus in a coherent, navigable form.
- Framing: help users organize intent, prayer, and ritual without losing grounding.
- Application: support personal growth aims (health, wealth, power) with clarity, ethics, and action.

## Audience
- Practitioners and learners of Solomonic and related traditions.
- Users seeking structured reflection and intention‑setting anchored in primary sources.

## Problem
- Texts are scattered across external sites with inconsistent formatting.
- Ritual plans are hard to structure and sustain.
- Spiritual practice can drift without reflection or grounding.

## Solution
- A source‑stable local corpus with clear citations.
- A ritual planner that pairs intent → reading → action → reflection.
- A lightweight companion flow suitable for mobile.

## Principles
- Source‑first: preserve original text and citations.
- Grounding: pair ritual with practical actions and journaling.
- Non‑harm: emphasize positive intent and personal responsibility.
- Transparency: show sources and provenance for every excerpt.

## MVP Features
- Text library with search + citations.
- Intent → suggested readings/prayers.
- Simple ritual checklist + journal prompts.
- Basic progress tracking (streaks, outcomes).

## Non‑Goals (MVP)
- Claims of guaranteed outcomes.
- Automated “spellcasting” or monetized promises.
- Heavy social or community features.

## Success Metrics
- Users can find and cite sources quickly.
- Ritual flows completed with reflections logged.
- Retention driven by clarity and practicality.

## Data Inputs
- Localized corpus under `docs/source_texts/`.
- Structured index derived from those texts.

## Current State
- Core sources downloaded and documented.
- Need: indexing, cleanup, and integration into a searchable dataset.
