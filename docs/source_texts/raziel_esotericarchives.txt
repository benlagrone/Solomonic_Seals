This text was well known by the end of the fifteenth century. 
According to Joshua Trachtenberg, it was probably compiled in the thirteenth century.1 

Trithemius mentions it as one of his 
sources for his Steganographia. 
It was also apparently used by Agrippa in his 
book On Occult Philosophy
on which see the critical edition by 
V. Perrone Compagni.

  It should be noted that the term raz ("mystery") is borrowed from Old Avestan, and may suggest a Persian influence.
  

The following English translation of the Book of the angel Raziel,
is text is taken from Sloane MS. 3846 in the British Library, fols. 128r-157v.
The text is closely related to that in Sloane 3826, though neither seems 
to be directly based on the other. 

A transcription of the text from Sl. 3826. 
has been prepared by 
Don Karr.
I have noted some variants from Karr's transcription (abbreviated K).

Liber Salomonis

In nomini dei potentis vivi & veri, & eterni &c.

  

  VRL1300 10v; Halle 5r.
  

In the name of allmighty God living & very & everlasting &
without all end which is sayd Adonay, Saday, Ehye, Assereye I
begin this booke which is said Cephar Raziel with all his appurtynanuts2 
in which be 7 tretises complete or fullfilled that is 7 books.

  
  

  2. i.e. appurtenances.
  

Dixit Salomon g'lia [=gloria] & laus cum multo honore &c3

  

  3. VRL1300: Dixit Salomon grã [=gracia] & laus cum maximo honore...
  

Salomon sayd glory & praysing with much honour be to god of all creatures 
he that is singuler which made all things at one tyme. And
he is one god very mighty he alone that is & that was & which 
evermore shall be. & which had never an even or any like him
neither he is to have. And he is singuler without end, Lord alone without 
corruption, holy, cleane, meke & great all things seeing, hearinge, & 
wise & in all things mighty. And I begin this booke to put an ensample3
that who ever that hath it blame it not till he have read & heard
all or some what of it, & then prayse be god maker of all things.

  

  3. ensample: exemplar.
  

These be the 9 precepts.

Incipiunt precepta / here begine ye p[recepts]

Non credas esse plures nisi unum singularem &c.

  
  

  VRL1300 11r, Halle 5r, which call these de castigationibus Salomonis.
  

[1] Ne trowe5 thou

[5] Ne loue thou not neither fellowship thou more unwise men 
then wise men. And evermore love you many wisedomes & good

And if thou with holdest these 9 precepts in

Postquam sensus &

After that witt & knowledge &
might & very will overcometh all things with good witt & good discretion.

Therefore I will expound or make plaine & open this Booke which
is of a great power & of a great vertue. I Salomon put such
a knowledge & such a distinction, & explanation in this booke to evry 
man that readeth or studieth it, that he know whereof he was and from 
whence he came. know ye that after I Salomon had xxx yeares 
wich are halfe in the 5. day of the month of hebreys, which was the
sixt feriall7 day the sonne being in the signe of Leonis. In that 
day was sent to me from Babylonie of some Prince that was 

[129v]
greater & more worll8 then all men of his tyme some Booke
that is said Cephar Raziel, which containeth 7 books & 7 treatises.

  
  

  7. ferial: i.e. festival (Lat. feria).
  

  8. VRL1300, Halle: venerabilior ("more venerable"). K: worshipfuller.
  

Nota tempus in quo Salomon fuit pv adeptus istum librum & quomodo &
a quo venit sibi. 

Know thou the tyme in which Solomon gate (?) this
booke & how & of whome it came to him. 

Iste liber est magnæ
virtutis & magnis secreti &c. 

This booke is of great vertue &
of greate privity. The name of the Prince that sent it to me
was Sameton,9 & one of the tway [=two] wisemen that brought it to
me was said Karmazail,10 & that other Zazont. The name of
this expounded in Latin is Angelus magnus secreti Creatoris.
That is to say the great Angell of the secret Creator. And in
hebrew Cephar Raziel that is the booke of Sothnes & of fullfilling
& it was the first booke after Adam written in language of Caldey [=Chaldaean]
& afterward translated in hebrue.  And know each man that
readeth it, that in it is all Semiforax, that is the great name
compleate with all his names whole & euen & with his vertues &
his sacraments & I found in it 7 bookes that is 7 treatises. And
know yee that I found the first & the last full darke & the twey11
middle more playne. And allthoug I found them darke, I
expounded them as much as I could & might. And the 7 treatises
of this booke be these.

[Contents]

The first is said Clavis for that in it, is
determined of Astronomy, & of the starrs for without them we
may doe nothing.

The second is said Ala, for that in it is determin'd
of the vertues of some herbs, of stones & of beasts.

The third is said
tractatus Thimiamatus for that there is determined in it of Suffumigations
& of allegacions of them & diuisions.

The fourth is said
the treatise of tymes of the yeare or of the day & the night for 
that it is determined in it when euery thing ought to be done
by this booke.

The fift is said the treatise of Cleanenesse for that
there is determined in it of Abstinence.

The sixt is said Samaim for
that it nempness [nameth] all the heauens & her angells & the operations or
workings of them.

The 7th is the booke of vertues for that
then is determined of vertues & miracles for there be told the
properties of the Arte of Magicke, & of his figure & of his ordinance
of the same.

And Then I began to write all these treatises 
in a new volume for that one treatise without another suffiseth
not to the holynes of the worke; therefore I made an hole booke 
to be made of 7. treatises. Therefore Solomon bad to his 
writer Clarifaton11 that he should write it which knew well the 
language of Caldey of Inde & of Ebrew [Hebrew] & Syrike & his right explanation 
Notheles12 Salomon after that Clarifaton said corrected it & dressed13 after that 
it should be the better & ordeined it in the better manner that he might.
Clarifaton said that was the writer of Solomon that this booke is of such
greate vertue, priuitie & of full greate honour & it was sent to Solomon
for such great price & most loue. And euerych treatise of these was
written by it selfe, but although it be so it ought to be one booke alone
by it selfe, for none of those should suffise without another
wherefore, it is necessary that they be together. wherefore Solomon
ordeyned that all were one boke as it ought to be, & as it

[130r]
ought to be read & wrought & he ordeyned much better then philosophers 
had ordeyned & he taught how a man ought to doe his worke by it. And
he put euerych treatise by it self, & euery chapter by it selfe, ordeyned 
all till to the end of the booke. And put in this booke Semaforas yt
is the booke of 17 vertues, how it [ought] to be written & of which ynk
& in what parchmyn, & with what penne & what man & in which
tyme & in what day & in what night & in what houre, after that
Solomon had expounded in the booke of Razielis. And how it
ought to be kept cleanly & with great honour.

Dixit Salomon
Qui videt & non cognoscit &c. 

  
  
VRL1300 12r; Halle 6r.
  

Salomon said, who that
seeth & knoweth not is as he that is borne blind & knoweth not
colours, who that heareth & understandeth not is such as a deafe man
who that speaketh & cannot expoune the reason is as a dumb man. 
who that considereth & knoweth not the consideration is such as a drunken
man. who that readeth plaine books, & understandeth not is as he that
dreameth. These proverbs Salomon said that a man beware well
in this booke. Salomon said in this booke hit (?) that Raziel the Angel
said to Adam that was the first man in this world And after that Moyses 
said to other prophetes in sothnesse [=truth] & we trowith so.13

  
  

  12. in soothness: in truth.
  

  13. we troth so: we pledge it is so.
  

[Of parchment or vellum]

Dixit Angelus Salomoni, vt omnes prophet tue operationes &c. 

  
  

  VRL1300 12r; Halle 6v.
  

The
Angell said to Solomon that all thy workings & peticions & wills be
fullfilled & it shall be made in all it that those shall couvite, that it
be in thy might. It behoueth yu that when thou haste this booke
of this or another examplar or ensample that those write it in such
manner in virgin parchmyn, & that it be not filthy neither of a dead
beast or in velume vitulino [=vellum], or in parchemyne of silke or in sattin14 
or in cleane cloaths or in parchemyn of a lambe or of a kidde virgin 
or of a fawne virgin & this is better then any of the other. 

  

  14. Lat. estari. K: 'Samatyne,' with 'sattin' written above.
  

[Of the ink]

And the ynke which thou shalt write be it of cleane galles15 & be it 
made with good white wine & hool [=whole] & with gum & vitriol & Mastick
& thur,16 & croco [=saffron]. And the third day where it shall well haue
residence, & shall be cleansed put thou there a little of Algaba &
of almea & put thou there of good muske or muske more then
of these three. And put thou there Ambram & balsamum & mirram
& lignum aloes & when the Incke [ink] shall be made be it boyled with
masticke & with thur & with ligno aloës & with somewhat of Thymiamate 
& muculazarat & then clause17 it well with a cleane thynne cloth &
the cloth be it three fold. Afterward put there mustum18 [musk] & ambram [=ambergris] and
almeam [=red storax] & algalia [=civet] & balsamum & mirram [myrrh] all well grounded & thou shalt 
meddle with the Inke full well. & the inke be it so by 3 dayes well couerd
in a sure place. And know thou that with this inke thou shalt write all the 
holy names of God & of his Angells & of his Saints & all thing in which his 
holy greate name is nempned19 or written, and all things that thou will werk (?) 
truly to be fullfilled with thy well pleasing or with thy seruice & what euer
thou putteth in thy inke be it newe & bright & pure & good. 

  

  15. Galls, especially oak galls were a common ingredient in preparing inks.
      The Sword of Moses has a prescription for ink made with
      'black myrrh (gall)'.  Gall nuts are prescribed in Le Grand Grimoire
      for the ink used for pacts with devils.

  16. thure: frankincense.

  17. K: clense.

  18. *muscum: musk. On these magical incenses also see Bruno, 
      De Magia.

  19. nempned: named.
  

[Of the pen]

And the Pen
with which thou shalt write the holy name be it of greene reade gathered
early ere the Sun arise & he that shall gather it he be cleane &
washen in runnynge water or in a quicke well & he be clothed
with cleane cloathes. And the Moone be it waxing with 

[130v]
Capite Draconis, or with Joue, for that they be true & very.

And when thou shalt gather it, thou shalt behold or looke
toward the Easte & thou shalt say thus.

Adonay el Saday
Iuvate me ad complendum voluntates meas cum arundine ista.

That is to say,

[Adonay, El, Saday,] help ye me to fulfill my wille with this Reade [=reed].

and when this is said thou shalt cutt one reade or tweyne or
as many as thou wilt with one stroke. And as Moyses said the
knife be it well playne & sharpe & hool [whole] as though we should
cut of a necke with it. And then take the Reade with thy cleane
hands &; make thou of it gobbets. And when thou wolte cutt
the penne, cut hit er that the Sunne arise or when it ariseth
with the pen & with this ynke thou shalt write all the names of
God holy seuerally. And as ofte as thou writest the name  of the
Creatour be thou cleane & so leyne20 and scoured & in a cleane
place, & thou shalt fast ere thou shalt write by 3 days & 
thou shalt be bathed in cleane water & thou shalt be rather
cleane by 9 dayes & cloth then thee with cleane cloths. And 
ordeyne to thee an house or a cleane place made cleane well
with beesomes21 & washen & watered & suffumed. And ordeyne so
that when thou writest hold thou thy face toward the East. And
write then from morro till to midday till that thou eate. And
after that thou hast eaten or drunken thou shalt not write
in it any thing. And if thou wilt write             sem~23 with his strengths 
the number of the moone be it euen, & most in the day of the
Moone or of Mercury, or of Jovis [Jupiter], or Veneris [Venus]. And be thou ware of
Saturne, & of Sole upon all. And Salomon said if thou puttest 
in the ynke of the bloode of a vowter or of a Turtur [turtle or turtle-dove], or of a
gander holly or all white the ynke shallbe much the better, &
with the more vertue. Also I say that if there were of Saphire
poudered & Smaragdo & Jagunua [=jacinth] & Topazio the Inke shall be
complete & fullfilled. And with this Inke & with this penne ought
to be written all the names of Sem[iforas]. And know thou that he
that shall write this booke ought to be cleane & fasting &
bathed & suffumed with precious aromatikes, that is with spices well
smelling. And it shall be great profitt to thee & to him that
maketh it or writeth it. And ech man that hath written this booke
or hath holden in his house euermore hold he god in mynde & his
holy angells & hit for which he hath made it, & he be euermore
suffumed. And glorify he god euermore. And put he his minde in wch
tymes of the iiij times of the yeare24 he shall worke, or of the iiij
tymes of the moneth or of the iiij times of the day with his night,
or of the iiij times of an houre. And euermore put he his mind to his
foure tymes which they ought to be as invenies in libro p'p'harum.

Dixit Salomon. Sicut si esset Castrum &c 

  
  
VRL1300 13v; Halle 7v.
  

Salomon said as
though there were a Castell full strong & his hightnes full great 
& high & enhaunced & well on eich side with walles

[131r]
environed & the gates in one place well strong & stable or ferme
& with keys closed, therefore it behoveth that who that would open
the gates of that close, & holsomly would enter into it, both with
out traueill of gift, & without brusing of his body. It is necessary
to haue the same keyes & none other of this Castill & of his gates
& of his Closings. Thus I say this that is for to know the starrs
& their names & their figures & their natures. And when they should
be good, & when they should be evill. And this I say of the fixe25 
& of the 7 erratic.26 neuertheles consider thou euermore the nature
of the circle of the 12 signes that is the tuares.27 And therefore it
behoveth that eich man that hath this booke that he hold it cleanly
& keepe he hit with great reuerence & with great honour. And
who that hath it & can read it, ne read he it not, but if he were
before of full cleane of body & with great witte. And I make every
man to know or wite that he ought not to worke by this booke in vein,
neither without witte, neither without lawe or reason, & this is when
every man doth to the contrary or when any reptiles or wode beasts
should lett thee or do harmes to thee. And to know thou that although
thou haue might & trust for to worke by this booke. And allthough thou
might haue great trust in this, thou shalt not worke but with great right
or law & with much reason. And thus understand thou of all thy contrarie 
And if thou workest otherwise by this booke then thou shouldest, thou
mightest much lett thee, that is if thou workest without reason, & if
thou were uncleane, or euill in thy selfe.

  

  25. i.e. stars.

  26. i.e. planets.

  27. VRL1300: curribus ("chariots"). K: towards.
  

Clauis istius libris est cognoscere & scire locu &c. 

  
  

  VRL1300 14r; Halle 7v.
  

The key of
this booke is to know & wite the places of the 7 bodies aboue & their 
natures, & their sciences & their domes, & all their vertues after that
it appeareth in the earth to us.

Formata debet esse omnis figura
cum exemplo vero, &c.

Eich figure ought to be formed with very & true
ensample.

 Therefore I put the figure of the keye in this booke
that no man trowe28, that without reason & profitt it be made. & I
put in figure one key with the skafte to the similitude or likenes
that there is one soleyn Lord & god which neuer had neither
shall haue any even or like to him. In the quadrature or that
<that> is 4 cornered is signified that there be fower Elements & no more.29

  

  28. trowe: suppose.
  

  29. VRL1300 and the Halle ms leave half a page blank here for the intended figure, but they are never rendered. 
  

And in this key is one triangle, which signifieth knowing might & will
for without these three may not any man do any thing in this world,
neither attayne to any profitt. And Salomon said that the shafte
of this key is as Raziel said to Adam vnite or one head. And the
quadrate is as 4 virtues, that be in hearbs & wordes & beasts. And
they be to the similitude of Elements which openeth & doth all.
And the 7 wardes be 7 Angells which have might in the 7 heavens
& in the 7 days of the weeke as furthermore I shall teach you. And the
triangle signifieth man which is in body & soule & spirite. And these
above said ledeth together all the world as it was compownded in highnes
& in lownesse. 

Postquam huivsque diximus oportet nos dicere, &c.

After that we haue said hitherto it behoueth us to say for this booke
that is said of the key of the 7 bretherne. And these 7 bretherne haue
among themself 12. remes29 for to deuide or departe. And in eich reme
beth xxx cities. And in every city be 60 Castells, & in euery Castell 60
Caldee that is feldy or wilde townes. And this ensample Salomon found

[131v]
& made distictions & said: There is one father & hath 7 Sonnes
& these 7 sonnes be germaynes30, for after that they be of the
same father germayne. And the elder is more hevy among all
other. And the middle in the middle more ordinate then all.
And other letle be in the br middle on (?) fellow shiping
hit euermore. So thlie (?)31 tweyne of these be not much seuered 
from hit. And these 7 brethern said Solomon be:

  

  29. reme: realm. Lat. regna. K: 'realmes' (here and in other passages).

  30. germains: siblings.

  31. =sothlie = truly? K: they.

  and לבנה
  Levanah (the Moon.)
  

know thou
the houses of Planets. And Salomon put names to the 12
remes of germaynes. And they be said signes. And he beginneth
to make distinction.

And he gaue to the fighter that is Mars, that
he should rest & should not fight in the reme of the signe of
Arietis. And of this vertue he is in the reme of the East. And he
gaue him in the reme of the world the signe of Scorpionis, that
he should fight strongly & that he should neuer rest & he is in
the 8th reme from the first.

And afterward he gaue to the faire 
Noge i.e. veneri twey remes of the which one hath the halvendle1 (=sign?) of 
Tauri that is from the highnes of the head with his hornes till to
the nauell.

  
  

  1. Halvendle (halfendele) = the half part. Lat. unum regnum est in signo medietatis tauri 
  ("one of the realms is in the middle of the sign of Taurus").
  

Another is the 7th from the first that is Libra and
otherwhile venus is aboue that is in the north & otherwhile beneath
it is in the south. And so he hath enherited hit in tway parties. 
And when he gaue to the Paintor which is the writer that is 
Mercuries twey remes, of which one hath twey men embraced 
that is clipping together himselfe. That other hath a faire virgin 
winged & neuermore would be deuided or departed from women for 
these ymages be such & he displeaseth euermore to go much 
from the south into the North. And he gaue to the Malis (?)33 2. Lune
for that Leo goeth euermore one reme & for Leo wole not much
stand in her house & her signe is a fish [=Pisces], & that is said Cancer, wch
hath many feete & he signifieth by this Leo wole much go for
that Leo is under other brethern, this suster [=sister] alone.

And he gaue to the middle Brother which is the lord of all 
other: & he commandeth all & is more onrned (?)34 or fayre

his signe is as the Lyon that sheweth him lord upon all beastes. So he 
is stronger & of more lordshippe upon all his brethern. And then 
remayned twey bretherne of the party of the South. And the
elder tooke twey remes one about another for this that he should
neuer be ouercomen in the signe of the Reme well meridionall or
south & he is one beast with one horne in his fronte. And the signe
of that other Reme is as a man that heldeth out many waters & this
broder is said the old Sabaday. And than taketh that other brother
for heritage on his right side the Reme with the signe of half a
man & of halfe an horse & it is said Sagittarius & on the left
side of Piscium. Know ye heere the natures of Signes. And
Salomon said, Aries is a Signe very hott & drie colericke &
so is Leo & Sagittarius & they haue might in the East. Taurus
is earthy cold & drie melancolious & so Virgo &

[132r]
Capricornus & they haue might in the South. Gemini is very
hott & moyst & sanguine & so libra & Aquarius & they haue
might in the west. Cancer is watry feminine moist and
phligmaticke & so Scorpio & Pisces & they haue might in the North.

Iam diximus de naturis & signis, & eorum complexionibus
&c.

Now we hau said of natures & signes & of the Complexions
of them. And then say we of the nature & of the Complexions
of germaynes & what they signifieth. The first heigher
that is said the old, Sabaday is Saturnus the Nature of which is
cold & dry for that it is much straite & melancholiouse & it signifieth
fathers, & wrath & discord in lands. The second is said zedek, &
he is temperate for that he is betwixt the old Sabaday & the hott
Madin, & Zadek is hott & moist sanguine in fauour sweet, &
it draweth a good ayre & it signifieth good and honour & vertu.

The third is the fighter madyn & he is hott & dry euell &
lesser & brenner, rauisher & lyer. The forth is haminu [or hamina] i.e. Sol, 
middle among other hole (?) & mighty & worll. & all the other brethren 
shameth & dreadeth him & he is much soth faste & stronngr. The 
fift is the faire Noga called cold & moist glad phlegmaticke fatt 
& flesht & well seeming in all his members & cheres & he signifieth 
good singds (?)35 & he is much glad among women. The sixt is the writer 
& the fore speaker cocab. This holdeth him selfe withall & serueth to 
all & signifieth writers & teidyngs & voyces after that it shall be 
with hit that with everych he holdeth himselfe when he is with 
it. The seuenth brother is Labana [Levanah] & it is Malx, & it is could [cold] 
& moyst & it signifieth brethern & itt bareth eich month the 
maundements of brethern to brethern. After that it is seuered from 
them.

Deinde Loquamus de septem fratribus quare dicuntur

 And then speak we of the 7 brethern why they be sayd 
the keyes of the world, & which this world may not excuss neither 
excuseth.  And these were formed as 4 brethern, which be said the 4 
elements & they hau after signification wit & discretion & might 
complete & honest & strengt & everych may in his hemispheare yt 
is empire. As an Emperour in his empire, or as a prince in his lordship. 
And they hau might on the 7 parties which we seyne Climates. And 
know thou that these bene mighty upon all beasts heere formed. And 
Salomon said prophetes clepeth these brethern 7 quicke spirits & hooly 
And wise men sayden that they were 7 lamps brennynge or 7 candlesticks 
of light & of life. And all prophetes clepeth 7 heauenly bodies 
which be 7 Planets & of cominle they be said 7 starrs. And 7 brethern 
be kept of 4 beasts full of syen before & behynd which be the 
parties of heuen. East, West, South, North. & they hau might in 
these foure parties of the world & in 4 times, & in 4 natures with her 
complexions & with all her parties & in the 4 Elements. And with this together 
ledde and moued all things moueable of the commaundement of 
God that put them in their places.

Dixit Salomon Sicut fuerunt semper status superius &c. 

Salomon 
said as there were euermore states aboue without corruption 
so know thou that there is now & shall be euermore. And for this 
we understandeth the bodies aboue cleane & good & made without 

[132v]
corruption. And the nether bodies uncleane euill treated & 
broken & eich day they falleth & ben corrupted. And this 
corruption resteth not neither is made weary of the which 
we understand that the nether bodies mought not excuse 
the ouer bodies. And all things which we sene beneath him 
rote & beginnynge for things aboue. for things aboue be 
with out life & withou dolour. And things beneath by the 
contrarie hau death with dolour. & things aboue haue duringe 
without corruption. And things beneth eich day faylleth & 
be corrupted & minished. And all prophets sayn that if these 
lacked any one of the ouer bodies that is of these that be much 
aboue X. Ml 36 betwixt tho that we sene & tho that we se not. 
Know thou that it were a greate precipitacion & destruction & 
confusion in land & in sea & in the 4 Elements if it were 
broken or euill treated any of the bodies above. And if there 
failed one of the 7 brettern the Earth  should come againe 
to his first stake, when all the Elements were cintuse.37
And if any of them bodylie had receiued corruption know thou 
that it were destroyed all thing that receiueth soule or life.
And know thou as the 4 Elements be turned downward they 
be not turned without some reason of the 7 aboue. & this 
sayth the philosopher when the Sunn is destroyed eich life 
& eich soule is destroyed. And when the Moone is destroyed 
the ligatures or bindinges of the Sea be destroyed. And 
know thou that Saturnus is earthly & holdeth all the Earth in 
a ballance that it is not moued. And Jupiter the ayre 
& Mars the fier. And Sol the day & men. And Venus the 
fayrer parties of the world. & Mercurius Reason. And 
Luna the Earth Sea & waters & their powers. And know 
thou that euerych after that is were or shall be in his exaltation 
ordeyned & bounden with the sonne that reasons & words 
& speachs should be good betwixt men. And as ofte as Mercurius 
were ioyned in Virgine in the same point with Sole direct 
& not retrograde make we sutill things & reasonable. 
And as oft as Sol were in Ariete so many yeares unlike he 
geueth  unto us. And as oft as Saturne were in Libra so many 
mutations he giueth in lands. And as oft as Jupiter is ioyned 
with Saturne in an Earthen signe so many diuerse mutations or 
chaungings he giueth & he changeth lawes & sects38 & 
Lordshipps. And thus understand thou in other complexions 
of Planetts after the states of them & their beholdings that 
is said aspectus.

Et Dixit Hermes istam rationem super

 And Hermes said this reason upon them

to Mars,] Venus the 
left, & Sol the right eye, Luna the left. Mercury the 
mouth.39 These 7 hooles thet hau in power aboue upon the 
head of a man. And Salomon said that a man is a 
measure which is said Palmus made with hande in ye which 
bene all the vertues of the world, & of the 7 planets & that 
is only the head of a man. Wherefore every man is likened 

[133r]
to his Starre & to his Elements. And Salomon said when I 
found a Spirite aboue retrograde or combust, or euill treated. 
Thus I say that his body was euill treated beneath in which 
it was like or he signified in hit. And who that were so wise 
that he knew his Signe & planett & his starre aboue & 
his sign~atoar,40 he might do good & euill to himselfe & other men

The severall Signes also of the Zodiack take care of their members. So Aries governs the head, and face, Taurus the neck, Gemini the armes, ...."

Postquam diximus de 12 figuris [*signes] & planetis &c. 

After that we 
haue said of thhe 12 figures [*signes] & planetts & of radiis of them
we should say that ech Planet that were in ascendence it is nempned coniunctio. 
And how much the Latitude or bridth shall be lesse 
so much the coniunction is said stronger & if there is more 
latitude the coniunction is febler & so I say to thee in the middle 
of heauen. And od the points of the 12 houses which be the 
stronger places of all houses, I say the point of the first 
degree of the house. And eich starre that were lesse & hath 
upon himselfe another, thilke is said41 that it hath power & 
goeth upon another 

from starr to starre & this ech starr that 
diuerseth from another by 60 degrees before & after: it is said 
aspectus sextilis, that is the sixt beholdinge. And ech planet 
that diuerseth 90 degrees before & behind, it is said in aspectu 4to.
that is in the 4th beholding. And ech planet that diuerseth 120 
degrees before & behind it is said in aspectu tertio, that is in the 
third beholding. And ech planet that diverseth by 180 degrees is 
in opposition in that that [sic] it is in the Contrarie place. The[se] be the 7 
beholdings & no mo duo tertii duo 4ti and duo sextiles, & unus 
oppositus, that is to sey, tweyne42 in the third, tweyne in the fourth & 
tweyne in the sixt & one contrary as against. The coniunction 
is complete when they be in one degree. Double coniunction 
of twey good or temperate sheweth double good. As twey euill 
by the contrary sheweth much euill. Twey sextiles beholdinge the 
ascendent auaileth one good of terno. And twey terni auaileth 
in beholding the ascendent, one good fortune in the ascendent. And 
twey quarti in beholding the ascendent auayleth one greiuous or 
heavy, if there were euill sters. And twey opposita auaileth one 
in fortunate in the ascendent or in the oppo~ita. And twey quarti 
auaileth as much as a starr falling or combust or retrograde 
that is letted in the ascendent, one fortune or tweyne in the 
ascendent and another of sextili, & another of terni beholdinge 
the ascendent sheweth much good hasty or highing. Twey evill 
in the ascendent or one with another in opposito that is in the contrary 
or of falling they shew 

a greiuous & long impediment. And 
if they be falling & letted it shall be wors, one fortunate in 
ascendent beholden of twey ternis it sheweth much good, & how 
much there were mo wittnesses upon the figure of which thou 
enquirest or seekest, or of which thou workest so much it shall be 
the better. And if three planets beholding the ascendent with good 
beholding & twey euill, the good ouer the euill & so of other. One 
infortune & in hascendent beholden of twey quartis sheweth much 
griefe. Caput draconis is much better then cauda. Ech Planet 
in his head of the same degree more Lordshippeth in the figure for 
that it is twey in latitude to the weye of the Sunne & it profitteth

[133v]
in going toward the party of the north. Ech planet in the tayle 
of the dragon is ministring of his worke that goeth toward 
the South.

Luna coniunct or ioyned with Saturnu & Marte 
in the ascendent it constrayneth & thristeth43 diuells. Saturnus 
maketh in deuills strenght & great power. Luna coniunct 
or ioyned with Joue [Jupiter] & Venere [Venus] in ascendent it sheweth 
great dilection & great loue in eich good thing. Luna ioyned 
with Martis & Saturno in th [sic] ascendent it sheweth impediment 
but if the planet were of good receiueying. Luna 
ioyned with Sole in one point [sheweth] greate grace & that if they 
were good. Luna ioyned in falling (?) & to Mercury in the 
asce3ndent it sheweth the contrary. Luna in ascendent 
by it selfe signifieth after that the planet to which it is 
ioyned. Luna with Capite Draconis in the ascendent sheweth 
good. Luna with Cauda [Draconis] or Combust or ioyned with 

a starre 
letted or in euill setting it sheweth much euill. When caput 
Draconis Lune were with capite Saturni, & there were 
Luna or Saturne & there is worke of celsan made it 
signifieth upon burdinger (?) of deuills fowle & euill. Ech 
planett that is with dracone of another & both be ioyned 
it sheweth a soth & or vemp*eprke44, & more in the ascendent. 
And if Caput draconis were of Jouis or Lune & these twey 
coniunct or ioyned in th ascendent it sheweth much good & 
encreasing of good & of honour. And if it were in cauda 
not only when there were twey Cauda Draconis that is of 
Lune & of other they be full euill when luna were with 
them. When Caput draconis Lune were with capite draconis 
Martis, & Luna & mars in thilke point it sheweth strength 
& might. And if Cauda with Cauda & Luna & Mars together 
it is full greivous & euill. after yt euerych is euill after 
the place or beholding of another. Caput draconis & Luna 
in Capite Arietis Luna Sol in Zamni sheweth great might & 
great honour. And by the contrary in Libra beneth with cauda 
draconis. Caput draconis with capite veneris sheweth much 
loue & in cauda the contrary. Caput draconis mercurii 
with capite draconis Lune sheweth worke of reason & of 
voic & of many sownes [sounds]. And in cauda Lune with Mercury 
& Saturno it sheweth us the beholdinge of many experiments. 
Lune in capite sui draconis sheweth & if there were Jupiter 
or venus it shall do the worke of Jouis or of Veneris & it shall 
profitt in all good as these be good. Luna if it be in cauda sui 
draconis & Mars 

& Saturne with hit or they beholdeth it with 
euill beholding sheweth as euill as we haue said of Saturnus & 
Marte. And we haue said that Saturne norisheth diuills & 
Mars draweth & thresteth & figureth them. And Saturnus 
gathereth together many deuills; Venus & Saturnus gathereth 
togeher diuills & winds from beneth. A good starre 
in the ascendent & luna ioyned with a good starr

[134r]
sheweth much good: and the begining in all hit in which were dn~s 
quarte that is the end Lord of the 4th And if the 4th house is well 
beholden of good all the end of the thing (?) shall be good when the lord 
of the forth house were euill & euill treated it sheweth noyi & euill. 
A signe ascendent sheweth the body. The Lord of the Ascendent 
or the planet that is in the ascendent or which beholdeth it sheweth 
it his spirit. And the Lord of the houre signifieth his soule & his will. 
And thus understand thou in other domes the body & the soule & the 
spirit, ffor these 3 know thou that they make the body of a man 
safe & hoole.

Mars in Capricorno. And Sol in Ariete. And Venus in Piscibus.
And Mercurius in Virgine. And Luna in Cancro. And know thou

Mercurius in the Ascendent. & Luna in the 3. And th ascendent hath

be in the 12 house, & thou shall profitt if thou chesest [choosest] wel. And 
Salomon said. Ech man that worketh by this booke it behoueth 
that he know all these thinges, that is reasons, which here I wyl 
not expowne to thee that is that thou know in which tyme thou were 
[born] of the 4 tymes of the yeare. And in which month of the months 
of Lune. And begin you from the Lunacion of the month of Mercury 
where euer Luna prima were. And all secret or priuity 
be yt axed in Saturno with aall deepnes. And all honour & 
substance be it asked upon Joue. And all strife & battell & 
hastinge of Marte. And all cleauenesse & lordshippe of Sole. 
And all fairenes & dilections or loves & fattnesses of venere. And 
all reasons & witts & subtilltyes of Mercurio. And all changing 
& fortune of Luna. And of these 7 thou shalt aske euermore 
councels where thou findest them in their houses & 
signes. And all as they should show to thee deme thou upon them 
in all good & euill.

Now we hau fullfilled here with the 
helpe of God the Treatise that is said Liber Clauis, that 
is the booke of the key.

Here endeth the first booke &

Dixit Salomon sicut alæ auium sunt membra &c. 

Salomon said As the wings of fowles or birds be members that leadeth 
the foules to the place where they desire to be, so by vertue of stones 
& of herbs & of beasts that liueth in flying & swimming, in going, in 
creeping thou might attayne to thee that that the wolt, yf thou chesest 
the natures of them, the properties & vertues. And therefore wee 
clepeth this booke Alæ, that is wings for without wings nether 
fowles neither fishes mought moue themself. And so as wings beareth 
bodies toi highnes upward & to fundaments downwards & into  longitude 
& latitude that is in to length & bredth. So by the vertues of Stones 
& of herbs with grace & with much might of Sem~ [Semiforas] know thou that thou might attayne yt thou couetest to do as to heale & make sicke 
or stand or go.

Dixit Salomon sicut Lapides sunt mundiores &c.

Salomon said as 
stones be cleaner & fayrer then gold & in 4 vertues of this world as 
be stones, herbs, wordes & beastes. I say that in the beginning of this 
booke [Cepher] Raziel that was crowned with 7 stones of great power, & he 
put them in his booke. The first is Rubinus [ruby]. 2. carbunculus. The 
second Smaragdus [emerald]. The third Saphirus. The 4 berillus. the 5 Topazius. 
The 6 Jaguncia [jacinth]. the 7 Adamas. And of the vertues of these stones 
Raziel hath spoken & said that they were crowned of 7 Angells 
which hau might on the 7 heauens. & of the 7 dayes of the weeke.

And 
Raziel said know eich man that hath this booke, that in this booke be the 
more vertues of this world. And the first vertues of this booke that is 
said of 4 wings be the 

vertues of stones. Wherefore know thou that by 
stones alone thou might doe wonderfull things, if thou hast well 
knowen as thou shouldest do with all other Images. If thou keep them 
cleanly & reuerently.

De Prima Ala.

Et dixit Salomon. Scias quod in prima ala sunt &c. 

And Solomon 
said know thou that in the first ala or wing be 24 precious stones great 
& of great power to similitude, & signification that there be 24 houres in 
the day & night. Salomon began & said. I put or set the first 
stone Carbuncum, 1.e. rubinum, For that it is brighter & clearer & fairer 
& of more price aboue all other stones. And I woll say of his colour & his 
power & his vertue, & of his seale & of his figure that ought to be 
in it. And thus I shall say in all other stones. Ech stone signifieth 
durability or lastingnes without end. The colour of Rubin is as the 
colour of fire sparckling. And his power is that he shyneth by night as 
starr or as a flame of fire sparklinge. And the vertue of it is that it 
maketh good colour of men that beareth it reuerently. And it encreaseth 
his good of this world among other men. And the ymage which thou ought 
to put in hit ought to be as Draco that is a dragon well fayre with dread.

The second stone is Topazius of which of which the colour is cytrine as of gold. his 
power is that if it be put in a caudron with feruent or boyling water 
it with holdeth that it may not boyle which is for great 
power of making could. And the vertue of it is that it maketh a man 
chast that beareth it with him & it giueth benevolence or well willing 
of great Lords. And his figure is a Faucon [falcon]. 

The third stone 

[135r]

is smaragdus this stone is greene & faire upon all greenenesse, and it is 
not heavy as other. And his power ia to keepe the light, & it healeth 
the face. And it doth many wonderfull things. And his vertue is to encrease 
riches. And who that beareth it in gold prophecieth things to come. And 
the figure of it is Scarabeus that is a man~ flye.

 The 4th stone is 
Jaguncia [jacinth] the color of which is red as the graynes of an apple. Of these 
sothlie there will be well coloured some & some a little & some in the 
middle manner. his power is that he that beareth it is not infect with 
alien infirmity. his vertue is that he giueth health & honour, & keepeth 
the man bearing it hoole in ways or in Journeys. And his figure is a 
Lion well figured.

 The 5 stone Crisopazius of which the colour is 
greene & within it hath similitude as though it had golden dropps. And 
his power is to defende a man from the podagrie. And his vertue is that it 
maketh to prophecy things to come if it were in the hand cleane & chast. And 
his figure is the Image of an Asse.

 The 6 stone is Saphirus the colour of 
which is full ledy & faire as the colour of the pure cleane heauen. 
his power is that he healeth all infirmities that wexeth in a man of 
inflamacion & greuance of the eyes. And it cleanseth them much. And if 
in this stone be grauen the head of a man with the beard it delivereth 
a man from prison & from all pressure. And this stone accordeth to the power 
of great Lords & of kings. If this stone be kept cleanly, reuerently & chastly 
& that it be good oriental with it a man might attayne great honour & 
the profitt of it that he seeketh & coueteth. And sem~en putteth there the 
signe of a wether z. Arietis.45

  
  45. K: the signe of a ram. Aries.

  

The 7 stone is Berillus the colour of wch 
is of the eye or of sea water & some of them be round & some of 5 
corners. This stone ought to be cleare wthin & cleane and his power is to 
chauf the hand closed of him that beareth it. And if it be set in gold it 
giueth great freindshipe betwixt twey men if thou touchest them 
with it. And his figure is Rana, that is a frogge & it is of great 
power for to make peace concord & loue. 

The 8 stone is Onix [onyx]. this 
stone is full blacke, & his power is to giue him that beareth it many 
dreadfull dreames & dreades. he that beholdeth himselfe in it hath 
power upon all deuills in constrayneing them & in cleping & in 
gatheringe them together in speculeo tabileo [jubileo?] coniuring as it behoueth. 
And his figure is the head of a camell or twey heads betwixt twey trees 
that be said mirti. 

the ninth stone is said Sardus the colour of which 
is red & faire, & his power is to make other stones fairer. his vertue is to 
giue good colour to him that beareth it, and it is put in gold. And if 
there be grauen in it Aquila that is an Egle [eagle] it giueth great honor. 

the 
tenth stone is Crisolitus and it is of golden colour & sparkling as 
fire. his power is to gather together deuills & winds. And his vertue 
is to defend the place where it is from euill spiritts & dead men that they do 
not there any euill. And that deuills obey to thee. And his figure is 
vulture that is a vowter.

The 11 stone is said Cliotopia. And it is a 
stone of great power of which the colour is greene & faire & shineing 
& cleare with dropps like blood well red within. This stone is said the 
stone of wise men, of prophetes & of Philosophers. And this is honoured for twey 
things for the colour like to Smaragdo in greenesse, and in rednesse 
to Rubino. The price of this stone ouercometh the price of other, and of his 
vertues & proprieties. the power of this stone is that if it be put in any 
broad vessell full of water to the sunne it resolueth the water into vapour. 
And it maketh it to be raised upward till that into the forme of Rayn [rain] 
it be conuerted downeward. His vertue is that who that beareth it in the 
mouth or in the hand closed he may not be seene of any man. With this 
stone a man may haue power upon all deuills & make eich 
incantacion or enhantment [enchantment] that he woll. And in this stone ought 
to be grauen vespertino. thus he saith but I trowe it be vespertilio

[135v]

that is a backe46, or reremouse.47 

  

  46. backe: bat (Lat. vespertilio).
  

  47. Dormouse.

  

the 12 stone is Cristallus 
of which the colour is of water congeled of cold. his power is 
that he putteth asbtray of fire from him. And his vertue is that 
he encreaseth to norich [nourish] much mylke [milk] and good. And thou may

to gellij [jelly]1 & it hath corners, & if any man put it in an house 
to the beame of the sunne, so that the beames passe through it 
or by it, the colour appeareth of the Rayne bow [=rainbow]. And for this 
cause it is sayd yris that is the Rainbow. And this is his might 
for he hath 7 corners:2 And the vertue of it is to keep the place 
in which it is with health honestly & there ought to be grauen 
in hit a man that [+is] armed that beareth a bow & an arrowe. 

  

  1. Lat. gellu ("cold").
  

  2. VRL1300 and Halle both read sex angulos ("six angles/corners"). Yris, i.e. iridescent quartz 
  typically has the crystalline shape of a six-sided prism, and produces a rainbow when light is shined through it.

till [two] to three palmes or pawmes & no more. And when it is drawen

And know thou that the red be better. And where this stone 
were it keepeth the house & the vineyard or the place from

both in dedes & in vertue the colour of which is like to Berill, but 
for it is derker than it although it haue within full cleare & 
cleane beames or strakes. And there be found some of 6 corners 
& some of 5. And his power is to enclepe deuills & to speake

with mastice, thur, croco, & thou inclepest what dead man thou 
wolt that is knowen to thee & other. know thou that anone he 
shall appeare to thee & he shall be with thee in the same tyme. 
And graue thou in it a lapwing & before draganciam which is a 
middle herbe & it is said Columbrina.

  

  48. K adds "or a rod."
  

The 19 stone is Celonites
& it is greene as an herbe, And his power is that it wexeth and 
decreaseth as the moone. And his power is to make peace & concord
betwixt tweyn if in it were the figure of a swallow.

vertue is to hold a man hole in an alien land. And his Image 
is a man that holdeth his right hand straight forth to heauen. 

The 21 stone is Cerannus. This stone is of diuers colours after 
diuers climates & diuers lands. Otherwhile white, otherwhile 
browne & greene & red. And els where it is likened to yron [iron] 
& somewhere to copper & to sulphure & it hath as roundletts 

painted & little drops. And his power is to defende a place from 
thundrings & lightnigs. And his vertue is to defende from all 
enemies. And write thou in hit in one partie Raphael, Michael, 
Gabriel. And on that other side Pantaseron, Micracon. Saidalson. 
And thou berest & hast it in thy power thou shalt ouercom all 
enemyes & thine aduersaries. 

the 22 stone is Ametistus & 
it hath the colour of wine upon a white cloath or of rose, or 
violett. And this hath might to chase away fendes. And his 
vertue is to defend from drunkennesse. And his figure is Vrsus 
that is a beare. 

the 23 stone is magnetis or magnes. And it is of 
great weight & like to ferro brunito. his power is that he 
draweth dead yron [iron] as nayles, knife & sword. And his vertue is 
that with it thou might be in what house thou wilt & doe 
what thou wilt with men & with things of the house suffuming 
the house of hit & with this men made enchantments. And 
graue thou in it a man 7, armed when Luna were in Ariete 
or Scorpione ioyned with Marte. And Sol (?) be it beholding them of 
terno aspectu. And know thou that what manner images thou 
grauest in this stone such enchantments thou might attayne and 
beare with thee & thou shalt profitte. 

The 24 stone is Adamas 
& it is of middle colour & the better hath somewhat of greennesse. 
And his power is that with it other stones be grauen, & therefore we 
haue put it more straunge, and more utter.49 And his power or vertue 
is to keepe the members of a man safe & hole. And this stone is 
more &

better it selfe at price in enchauntmenmts and in inuocations 
of winds, spirits & deuills. And with this thou may send whateuer 
fantasy thou wilt. And his figure is of 5 corners. And 
know ech man who that woll beare with him a pretious stone, be 
he pure & cleane, when he would doe any thing with them. 
And eschew he or keepe himselfe from uncleannesse & keepe he 
them reverently in a quy iche or in a cleane place. And 
Raziel said in the houre in which thou wilt do of sem~ [Semiforas] beare 
the three stones aboue said & thou shalt profitt.

Dixit Salomon sicut aius corpus volare non pt &c. 

Salomon 
said as the body of a fowle ne may not fly without wing 
neither go wither he coueteth. So by science of one thing 
alone we mought not fullfill that wee desire. And for this 
we putte the second Key in this booke. And we say ne if [it?] the 
second, for that it maketh the second openinge.  ffor as this 
world is closed with 4 elements: so this booke is closed 
with [i.e. encompassed by] 4 sciences & 4 vertues. And now we haue said of stones, 
now say we of herbes. Know thou that in herbs is vertue of 
the most that may be. And some of naturalls of this world 
beth yt liueth of them as they that haue reason. And some that 
flieth & some which swymmeth, & wch goeth & which crepeth. And 
know thou that of trees & herbs some liueth much & some middle 
& some litle & that is to the similitude of beasts. Know thou 
that among herbs there be some with which thou may do good 
& euill. As to heale & make sicke. And so understand thou 
in these that shall be said furthermore. And Adam said by a 
tree came wretchednes into the world that is by the tree 

I 
sinned in it. And Raziel said, An herbe shall be thy life. 
And Salomon said, A tree shall be & shall wexe of which 
the leaues shall not fall. And it shall be medicyne of men.

The second wing is to the similitude of 24 houres, & of 24 stones.

De Secunda Ala.

  

  VRL 1300 25v. Halle 14b36 15v.
  

Prima herba est acyl almalit &c. The first herbe is acyl 
almalit & it is said Corona regia, and in Latin Ros Marinus. 
This herbe hath a myddle tree50 & good odour, & little leaues & 
his power is to chaufe contorte the brayne. And if an house 
be suffumed with it, it chaceth away deuills. The same doth 
Pionia. 

  
  

  Rosemary.
  

  50. tree i.e. stalk or trunk.
  

The second herbe is Artemesia & this is mother & 
first of other. But for that other is said Corona regis that is 
to say the Crowne of a kinge, we hau putt it first. Of this 
they saiden all that in all things that thou dost thou shalt 
put of it. And the leafe is middle greene on that one side 
& white on that other. And it wexeth middlly. And with this thou 
shalt clepe windes & all spiritts that thou wilt & thou shalt 
profitt. 

The third herbe is Canabus [cannabis] & it is long in shafte & 
clothes be made of it. The vertue of the Juse [juice] of it is to 
anoynt thee with it & with the iuce of arthemesy & ordyne thee 
before a mirrour of stele [steel] & clepe thou spiritts & thou shallt see 
them & thou shalt haue might of binding & of loosing deuills 
& other things.

The 4 herbe is said feniculus & it hath small 
leaues & a longe shafte. And it is an holy herbe and 
worshipfull. And it is medicine of the eyen & it 

giueth good 
light & it chaceth away euill spiritts & euill eyen in the place 
where it is. The roote of it chaceth away euill things & 
helpeth the sight.

The 5 herbe is cardamomu [=cardamom] & it is hott & 
of good complexion & it is of middle highnesse & it giueth 

[137r]
gladnes to him that useth it. And gathereth together Spiritts. Eate 
thou this when thou clepest or makest invocation, & if thou wilt 
made fame of it. 

The 6 herbe is anisum [=anise] & it is of chastity ioyned 
to camphore & thou shalt see that spiritts should dread thee. And 
it is a cleane herbe & it maketh to see secrett things & priuy, & 
the fume of this ascendeth much. 

The 7 herbe is Coriandrum, & this 
with holdeth the spirit of a man much with other, & it maketh a 
man as full of sleepe. And this gathereth much together the 
Spiritts. Wherefore euermore they standeth with it, so that it is 
said that if with this and Apio & iusquno [=henbane]51 thou make fumigatione 
compowned with much Lazaras z. leicula anone it gathereth together 
sp~ & therefore it is said herba sp~m [=spirituum]. 

  
  

  51. VRL 1300 27r: apio & iusquiamo (?) K: insquiano.
  

The 8 herbe is said persilium [=parsley]
which hath greate might for to chace away the spiritts of 
roches.52 And his vertue is to breake the stone in the bladder of him 
that useth it.

  
  

  VRL 1300 27r: petroxillum
  

  52. roches: rocks. (Lat. lapidem.)
  

The 9 herbe is ypericon [=hypericon] & it is a middle herbe thirled 
the iuyce of hit seemeth bloode. This is of great power for 
with the iuce of it & wit croco [=crocus], & arthemesia & with fume of 
radicis Valeriane [=valerian root] if it be written upon what frendshippe thou wilt 
of a Prince of Spirits of the eyre and deuills know thou that anon 
it shall be that thou couetest. And so upon spirits & winds. 

The 10 
herb is Apium [=parsley or wild celery]. this is of great power upon 

winds & deuills, and 
fantasies, & it is shaded & touched to shade & the (?) cloude alstisse for 
in it by winds & deuills & this alone maketh albo fortu~.1

& they be much contrary for one is kept 
with heauenly angells & another with deuills. z. apium. And this 
breaketh the stone of the reynes [=kidneystones]. And a woman with child use 
her it not, for it noyeth53 to the child. And it gathereth together 
deuills when suffumigation is made with it nisqrmo [iusquiamo i.e. hyoscyam i.e. henbane] and arthemesia 
[=artemisia i.e. mugwort]
Apium suffumed by 7 nights with fagar almeit,53b & gathered cleanly 
& the roote of it put & dried & than tempered with aqua lapidis53c 
suffume thou thee by enviroñ, when thou wilt, & thou shalt 
see fantasies & deuills of diuerse maners.

  53c. VRL1300 has aqua grandinis ("water from hail") instead of aqua lapidis.
  

The 11 herbe is 
Coriandrum [=coriander] of the secund kind which maketh to sleep much. And if 
thou make suffumigation of hit & Croco & [=saffron] iusgrm~o [=iusquiamo = henbane] & apio~ and 
papavere nigro [=black poppy] grounden together euenly & tempered with succo cicute [=hemlock juice]
& with ???.1 And then suffume thou the place where thou wilt 
hide treasure when luna were ioyned to Soli in angulo terræ, that 
is to say in the corner of the earth. Know thou that thilke treasore 
shall neuer be found, & who that will take it away shall be made 
fooles. And if in the houre of deposicion of the gold or siluer of the 
stones or ymages thou suffumest with thur, must, succo, ligno aloës 
costo (?) -- euermore deuills kepeth that place & euill winds. And know 
thou that it might neuer be disolued or fond out without Sem~. or an 
image made thereto by the point of starres.

  
  

  1. VRL1300: desiccatis ("dried"); K: msk ("musk").
  

The 12 herbe is Satureia 
this is of great vertue & of good odour & who that beareth it with 
him 

with arruc'la muris in the day of Veneris it giueth grace of goods 
& it taketh away from the place windes & euill fantasies.

The 13 
herbe is that is said sta~ [=sancta]53b & this is middle in lenght & hath little 
leaues: this ought to be holden worshippfully in holy places as in churches 
for it defendeth the place from euill things. And with his prophetes madeth 
dead men to speake that were dead by many dayes or fewe. In place 

[137v]
where is any euill he hath not might if he that bearetht it 
clepeth him not. And it giueth to him might upon thing which 
he would. And this herbe put upon the place where deuills 
be closed it constrayneth them & bindeth them lest they might 
moue themself. And Salomon said I found in the booke of 
Hermetis54, that who that taketh water in the 4th houre of the night 
& goeth upon the tombe of a dead man with Spirit he will 
haue speech, cast he water upon the tombe with this herbe 
ysopo. And the water be it suffumed with costo succo musto54b & 
say surge, surge, surge, that is to say, "rise, rise, rise," & come 
& speake to me. And do this by 3 nights, & in the third he 
shall come to thי & he shall speake with thee of what thing 
thou wilt.

  
  

  53b. sca (with a macron) is a very common abbreviation for sancta ("sacred").
  VRL 1300 27v; Halle 14_B_36 16v. Also called prophetarum in both those mss.
  Du Cange 
  identifies prophetarum as the herb 
  vettonica (=betony), 
  which has a matching folklore going back to Roman physician Antonius Musa.
  

  In their printed Sepher Raziel, Don Karr and Stephen Skinner (p. 171) interpret 
  sca as centaurea, citing "the Latin version", but this is not the case 
  with the Vatican or Halle mss at least. 
  

  54. For Liber Hermetis see Sloane MS. 3847, fol. 84-100: Hermes. Trismegistus. 
  Liber Magicus 17th cent. (Liber Hermetis tractans de 15 stellis 15 lapidibus 15 herb. 
  et 15 harum rerum figuris.)
  

  54b. VRL 1300 28r: subffumigata cum costo musco et suc et dicat...;
       Halle 17r: suffumigata cum costo musco et succo et suc et dicat...
     ("suffumigate with costus, musk, and juice, and say...")
  

The 14 is spillu~55 which is of great vertue: for it 
sheweth or maketh open in the ayre, that other mought not do. 
And it maketh to see spirits in the cloudes of heauen. And this 
with cicorea56 & garmone, & the tree yt swymmeth which is said 
Arbor cancri57 & ma~lie with rore pradij [p radii (?)] & with the tree 
that sheweth by night, & it is said herba lucens that is the herbe 

shineing. Yf thou makest with these an oyntement with the eyne 
of a whelp & with the fattnes of an heart [hart], thou might go 
surely whither thou wilt in one houre.

  

  55. K: psyllium.
  
56. K: scicorda.
  

The 15 herbe is maiorana 
this keepeth an house by it selfe & defendeth from euill infirmities. 
And Hermes said that genciana & veleriana [valerian] & maiorana [marjoram] 
availeth much upon great honour of princes & of great men.

The 16 herb is Draguncia. This is of great power & the highnesse 
of the roote of it ioyned with the tung of Colubri which is lett 
quicke. And the herbe be gathered when Sol is in the first degree 
of Cancri [Cancer], & Luna beholdeth mercur~ or is in the house of mercur~, 
or ioyned with him. Know thou that who that toucheth with this 
Clausures57 they shall be opened to him anone. And hermes said 
that it gathereth together winds & spiritts if mandragora were 
with it & capillus de zoara.

  
  57. K: clansures or locke.
  

The 17 herbe is Nepita. And if this 
with maiorana & Athanasia & trifolio & Saluia, peruca, edera 
& arthemesia with ysopo58 be ioyned & gathered together crescente
Luna die Jouis that is to say in the waxinge of the moone in the 
day of Jouis [Jupiter] in the morrow when the Sunne wexeth from the first 
degree of Arietis till into the first of Cancri. And when thou shalt 
gather him be thou cleane & washen worshipfully & stand thou 
toward the East. Know thou that the house & the place is 
amended where these 9 herbs were ioyned together & put them 
upon the gate of thy house & thou shalt profit euermore. And 
these 9 herbs ioyned be like to rubine

  
  58. K: maiorana and athanasia & trifolio and salina hermita edera and artemisia wth ysope
  

The 18 herbe is linu~ suffumigation 
of the seed of this with sere~psillii .z. azarlochona & radix 
viole & apii maketh to see in the ayre things to come & to say 
many propheces.

  

  See OP1.43: 
  "So they say that fumes made with Lin-seed [linseed], and Flea-bane seed [psyllium, Lat. Psyllii], and roots of Violets, and Parsly [parsley], doth make one to fore-see [foresee] things to come, and doth conduce to prophecying."
  A more elaborate method can be found in Muzzi's edition of Grimorium Verum.
  

The 19 herb is saluia [salvia]. This is of great vertue & 
the long leafe of it as lingue Agni & sharpe. this breaketh or 
disperseth euill shades & euill spiritts from the place where it is.
And it is good for to beare with him: for it holdeth a man hool, but 
a sicke man hold he it not with him.

The 20 herbe is Samina  

[138r]
[Sanina]. And so~men sayn that it is a tree. this is a tree of loue & 
dilection, who that can chese it. And if this with somewhat of croci 
& with Lingua Colubri be borne with him in a ring of gold and 
somewhat of pvi*ca [provinca] surely go thou before the king or before 
whomeuer thou wilt, & most if thou put with it the stone that is 
said Topazius or yf thou wilt Berillum. And if this ring were made 
when Luna is ioyned to Jovis in trino from Sole it is much the better. 
And it is said Annulus Solis that is the ring of the Sunne & it is 
of health & against infirmities & it is of grace & vertue & of 
honor.

The 21 herb is Nasturcium. This holdeth the members hole 
& there were with it Origanum & Pulegium & arzolla & be borne 
together with thee & thou eatest of them, thou shalt be hool wthin 
& without. And so if thou anoyntest thee with them and were 
suffumed with marrubio, albofor, & reubarbaro, & herba thuris it 
shall defend of many infirmities.

The 22 is an herb that it said 
Canna ferula. this is full dreadfull & greivous, & strong in worke. 
And if thou takest the iuce of it, & the iuice of cicute & ms~qim 
& Japsi barbati, & sandalum rubeñ & puprrm nigrum with this 
confection made fume thou what thou wilt, that thou see deuills 
and things & strang figures. And if Apm~ were with this know thou 
that from eich place suffumed deuills should flye, & if thou wilt 
thou might destroy euill spiritts. This suffumigation is full 
euill & dreadfull. for the fume of it & the worke ouercometh 
in malice & worketh most euill. And more strongly if Luna were 
with Saturno or in oppositio with Marte, that is in opposition of Martis.

The 23 herb is calamintum & it is likened to n~ite [? K: mynte] & it is of great 
vertue in good suffumigacions, & if there is with it on~ta [? K: menta] & palma 
xpi~ z Pionia. These be holden taketh away euill winds and 
spirits from a place & euermore it is against fantasies.

The 24 herb 
is Cicoreya. This is full good in all exorcisms & if it be ioyned with 
eri~go & pentafilon & ypericon & vrtica & verbena, and all be together 
& be borne at the necke & under the feete & be there the 
herb of 7 knotts & of 7 leaues z martagon & lilium domesticum 
& siluestre, that is tame and wild & herba angelica who euer 
hath these under the feete or sitteth about & putteth the other 
herbs to the necke & hath 7 rings of 7 mettalls in the fingers, 
know he that he shall haue might in 

binding & in loosinge, & in 
enchantinge & in unenchantinge, & for to do good & euill 
in eich place that thou wilt makeinge suffumigation of 
these 9 things. thur, albo, thymiamate, mastice, musco, ligno alöes [aloes], 
cassia, cinamomo. And if thou suffume thee with the 
things aboue said in environ & seist these names. Raphial [*Raphael], 
Gabriel, Michael, Cherubin, Seraphin, arrielim, pantaseron, 
micraton, sandalon, complete meam petitionem & meam voluntatem 
that is to say, fullfill ye my petition or axing & my 
will & they should fullfill it to thee. And these be the 
more names of the more 9 angells abouesaid. And know thou 
them & keepe them. And som~en sayn that they be the 9 orders 
of angells.

Heere endeth the 24 reasons upon the vertues of herbs of the 

[138v]
second wing. And these experiments were now written in party 
in Raziele, although Salomon put to of this there, & of the 
Saiues of Hermetis. And the herbs be put in the booke of Razielis 
for that with them we may be excused & worke with 
herbs as with Sem~ with fasting & words in good & euill. 
And [let] no man Joyne himself to Semiforas till he know 
himself in the first wing & in the second. And thus we 
shall say all thing that shall be to us necessary with 
the help of god.

De tertia Ala. [The third wing.]

Dixit Salomon super Alam tertiam sicut Corpus Solis &c. Salomon 
said upon the third wing as the body of the Sunne is more 
appearing & mighty upon all other bodies & brighter, 
& fairer & clearer. So the vertues of sensible beasts wch 
feeleth [K: flyeth] and sendeth out 

voice, & seeth. And so beasts of the 
third wing haue power upon the twey first wings of stones & 
of herbs & he put therefore in this Raziel 24 beasts with their 
names, & vertues & states. And the figures be 24 distincte & 
departed a twyne. And I will put upon eich element 6 
beasts euerich distinct from other & euerich of his kynde. And as the 
fier is the high lord & distinct from the 4 Elements. And the 
life of them all is purer and cleaner among them, therefore I 
beginne to say upon the beasts of fire, for as eich of the 
4 Elements hath his beast beneath, so the fire hath his aboue 
pure & cleane without corruption. And this fier that is aboue 
is not expounded of wexe & trees neither oyle, neither with 
other composition, but it is simple. And the things that liueth in it 
be the angels cleare & clean & bright like to the beames 
of the Sunne & like to the flame of the fire, or of a sparck 
of fire, or of a starre or of the Colour of Quickesiluer or of 
pure gold. And this similitude is naturall in the beasts of 
the fire, & the figures of them bene seeme such as the 
lighteninge in similitude & in deed. For as an Orison is a 
Messager to the Creator, so they be ready anon to good & 
euill & they seyn like things of prophetes that upon the 
4 Elements be heauens with their beasts of which wee 
should say furthermore.

The second spirit is much cleane, but 
derker then the ou~ & it is likened to the winde. And his figure 
after that he will take & after some of the 4  Elements to which 
he is ioyned, & he formeth himselfe in this manner either by water or 
by a cloude or by moystnes or by thicknes of some darkenes or he 
receaueth some body as fume of some kynde by falling in it either 
by vois or by sleep [K: shape] of a beast elemented by these he taketh 
forme after that the nature aboue disposeth. 

The third 
beast of which wisemen seyne is that euermore he fellowshippeth 

[139r]
spirit & most the corpulent & thicke of the spirit. And therefore his figure is 
found by night in places of drede & it is heard & seene & that ofte tyme. 
And the Colour of it is like to tp~i z after the nature of houre, ere it is 
made, otherwhile to the similitude of the body of which it went out. 
Wherefore sommen seeth otherwhile the soules of bodies in church yards 
hayes. And of these souls said the wise Hermes & the prophet that the 
soule that goeth out & hath might is not neither was but a man or 
woman, & upon such manner soules speaketh wisemen & clepest 
them spirituall & heauenly, spirituall for goodnes, heauenly for simplenes. 

The fourth beast is the winde. Eich day we hearen but we seen not 
although we seen other, & hearen not. And the works of the winde be seene 
to the eye after the party from which it cometh. And he hath such nature 
that if he is orientall or meridionall, that is East or South, he is hote. 
And if he is occidentall or septentrionall that is West or north he is cold. 
This we seene to haue greate power for it beareth clouds & waters, & 
tempests & haules [K: gayles]. And it stirreth the Sea, & troubleth the Sea & breaketh 
trees, & this is said quicke ayer, as the fire aboue is said quicke fire & simple. 
And therefore the Elements be said double or twey fold, that is to say fixe 
&  moveable. Moueable it is that it dwelleth in the corners of the Earth 
althoug it descend from aboue. ffor the 7 aboue bindeth & looseth it for of 
them it descendeth & it was formed of them & this is a great saeg' [? K: figure] in 
sea, in ayre, & in land as it cometh temperate. 

The 5 beast or vision 
is a fantasie that is a shade to the similitude of diuers colours or manners 
compownd of diuerse together. And this forme is made in desert place 
or in a corrupt ayre. Or other while it descendeth from hills to the 
similitude or likenes of knights & they be sayd Exercitus antiquus that 
is an olde ofte [*host or army]. And otherwhile upon waters to the similitude of faire 
women & well clothed, or in meades, & some sayne that they be faces. 
And otherwhile this befalleth in a man of corruption or malice of 
complexions & of humours that be in a man, & they be said 
demonaici for that it ascendeth the head & falleth upon the eyne, & 
such corruption maketh to see many fantasies. 

The 6 beast is 
said Demon. This descendeth in highnes to lownes & he was formed 
of pure matter without corruption. Wherefore he faileth not but shall 
euermore endure although he haue taken thicknes in darknes of the 
lownesse of the Earth & he is pure in matter and strong in body. And 
of this saith the wiseman that he knoweth all things that is. And 
by him Philosophers haue answeres & wisemen of all things, of which 
they will know the sothnes. And he dwelleth euermore in darkenesse 
& in obscurity & he is neuer seuered from them. And of this sayth 
the Prophet that he hath power of takeing forme or shape wch 
he woll in the Earth after the will of the Creator. And he is said 
a bright angell mighty & faire as the forme of the sonne & of the 
moone & of a starre or of an angell or of a cloud or of a fowle 
or of a fish or of a man, or of a beast or of a reptile that is a 
creepeing beast or any other forme which he wold. And all these 
aboue said without them know thou that they be impalpable, 
or unable to be feled that is that they may not be taken with hand 
neither be touched with fote for they be spiritts or windes. 

[139v]
And know thou that euerich of the abouesaid when it befalleth in any 
of the Elements he taketh a body of them although the life of them 
be of the fire & the dwelling of them be in the fire & their deeds 
fuyry, for they be fuyry. And Raziel said upon these 6 that invocation 
of them & appearing & constrayning & binding & loosing also 
to do good or euill by them, All is made with cleanesse [therefore] who that 
would clepe them or haue the seruice of them & with Orison and 
fasting & fumigation, & with praysing of god as thou shalt here 
furthermore.

Animalia æris tertiæ alæ vocantur aues &c. Beasts of the ayre 
of the third wing be cleped souls, for that they flyeth & they be of 
4 menynge. One is said runnyng. Another flying, & swimminge & 
going or creeping. Now say we of flying. And begynne we 
first of Aquila that is an Egle [eagle], for that he is a fowle flyinge 
much in height. And he hath Lordship upon all other fowles. 
The Eagle hath such a nature that he taketh his sonns or birds 
when they be little. And ascendeth them into a place when 
the Sunne is high. And then he drepeth the face of them to the 
Sunne & if they behold strongly the Sunn he deemeth them to be 
his sons & good. And if they behold not, he deemeth to be 
not his and euill & letteth them fall & dye. And a feather 
of him freteth another fether. And he seeth farre by one 
league or mile a little beast. A great beast sothly he seeth by 
9 leagues or by a days Journey. The eye of him with the heart 
haue great vertue & grace to a lord king or to a lord of a land, 
for that giueth to him grace in his reame.

The second fowle is 
said Vultur that is a Vowter [vulture]. This hath great vertue in all his 
members. The head of him helpeth against all dreames & against 
craft of Magicke. And the feete helpe against malefetes. 
And if an house be suffumed with 9 fethers of him it putteth out 
from it euill spiritts. The gall of him helpeth the eyne better 
then any thing of the world. Th' eyen of him put in the skinne 
of a serpent, & the tong of him in a cloth of silke red 
wlapped [sic wrapped] with them, helpeth in causes in which thou couitest to 
ouercome & for to wynne the loue of another lord. The wings 
of him put upon a bed defendeth a man sleeping from euill winds 
& from all greevance & from euill spiritts, neither may they may 
lett in all the house, neither any fantasies haue power nether other 
things.

The third fowle is Falco, that is a Falcon of whom 
the vertue is that of great Lords he is sett att much price. 

The boon of the highnes of the right wing ouercometh plees 
both in rauishing and in takeing away alien thing. and the 
heighnes of the left wing taketh away euill feuers. But 
we ought not to slea venatiue foules neither 

[140r]
hounds although they haue many vertues in themselues. And know thou 
that how many members be in euery beast, foule, fish or reptile, so 
many vertues distincte hath euery member by himself.

The 4 foule is 
a turtur1 simple & good. netheles if thou takest the male & the 
female together in a new potte with croco & provinca & cicorea 
gathered together upon them which thou wolt ioyne together if 
thou casteth the pouder of these upon them know thou that 
anon they shall be ioyned together. And it giueth great loue [love] to him 
that beareth the pouders with them.

  
  1. Turtur: turtledove.
  

The 5 foule is said Vpupa, that 
is a lapwing haueing a creast of fethers in the head as a cocke. 
And he hath many vertues. This hath one boon in his wings & it 
gathereth together deuills & spiritts of the ayer. The property of him is 
that who euer taketh the hearte of him & wlappeth [wrappeth] it in hony, 
And then assoone as he may swallow it, & drinketh the milke 
of a white or red or a black cowe, know thou that it maketh 
a man to say things to come. And he hath another vertue for who yt 
cutteth of the necke where a cocke croweth not neither may be 
heard, neither the voice of an hound, neither [where] wheate is sowen 
there & when he cutteth of his necke inclepe the deuills & then 
bear he with him the halfen deale of the blood. And of that other 
halfen deale anoynt he himselfe, euermore shall go with  him one 
of the deuills that is to witte, he whom he can inclepe which shall 
say many things to him.

The 6 foule is said Ciconia1 that is an 
haysoule, who that sleath him in the day of Lune & taketh the blood 
of the heart of him & anoynteth himself with it & eateth the flesh 
with se~re feni~l & with cardamomo & gariofilo, & ere he eate it suffume 
he himself with good odours as with thure mastic & cinamom & other such 
know thou yt he shall haue grace of enchanting which he wolle & of 
coniuring & constrayning the spiritts of the ayer & other spiritts that goe 
upon riuers & wells.

  
  1. Crane or stork.
  

These 6 foules abouesaid be an ensample upon 
all other. And when thou wilt know the vertue of any foule, do 
thou after the precept of this booke, Raziel, upon the booke of visions 
of Angells upon the begininge of tymes in the 12 months as thou shalt 
see furthermore.

Dicamus de piscibus marinus & aliis &c. Say we of fishes of the sea & 
other upon vi of them that is to witt of the more & middle that I  should shew the vertues of them.

The first fish is Balena [whale], the fattnes 
of which made liquid kept 7 yeares or more, for how much it is elder 
so much it is better. It healeth a man from eich gout & euill wind if 
he anoynt himself with it, if he anoynt the head with the blood of 
him it helpeth him much & yeeldeth him strong & more hoole. And 
it maketh to see verrt visions. The sperma of him is said Ambra. 
If thou suffumest tombes with this it gathereth the spiritts aboue 
downward. And of eich petition or axinge it maketh to giue answer. 
And Hermes said there is not such suffumigacions for to inclepe Spirits 
as Ambra & lignum aloes, costus, mustus, crocus & bloud of a lapwinge 
with thimiamate.1
These be meate & drinke & gladnes of spirits 
of the ayre. And these gathereth them together strongly & 
full sone. And wise men say that the sperme & blood 

[140v]
& the heart of a baleyne be principalls for to command the winds & 
spiritts who that maketh fumigations of them.

  

  1. Agrippa quotes this in OP1.43.
  

The second fish is 
said Delphin [dolphin]. And he is the knight of the sea. And as the Eagle hath 
might among foules, & the lion among beast in this manner 
hath the delphin in the Sea. Who that annoynteth of the bloode of 
him, the cloathes of twey freinds it maketh them enemyes or 
casteth the dry blood upon them. And who that beareth the heart 
of him maketh him hardy.

The third fish is Cancer. this hath 
6 feet, take & brenne him in panno livido & with the powders frote 
the teeth sofhlie it healeth them & yeeldeth them faire & cureth 
the Cancre in the mouth, if thou casteth it upon the fire wth 
somewhat of Stercosis humani combusti it gathereth together 
spirits.

The 4 fish is bright as an horne betwixt palenesse 
& whitenesse z piscis claudims or Cepia. This fish hath many properties, 
& this enchanters & prophetts knoweth well which made with 
this their enchantments & their transfigurations. So that when 
they would that an house should seeme full of water, or that 
a riuer should enter by the gate, they tooke  this fish & with thimiamati 
& ligno aloes & rosis & they fumiden an house & 
they cast there of the water of the Sea. And it seemed that 
the house were filled with water, & if he cast their blood it 
seemed bloud, & so if he cast Snow. And when they would that 
the earth should seme to quake then they cast there of the Earth of 
a plow. And they made there diuerse similitudes in all things 
after the thing which they put in the fumigation. And know 
thou that it dureth so much as the fumigacion in the house, & 
with the gall of him also they made many enchantments, for that this 
beast is much unlike to other.

The 5 fish is Murena [eel], & he is 
lentiguromus (?) 
the vertue of this is that enchanters beareth the 
powder of him with them for to make enchantments.

The 6 fish 
is rana viridis, & if thou take it upon what woman thou wilt 
and namest the names of the angels of the month in which thou 
were [K adds: borne as I thinke] which be furthermore within in libro visionum you might 
do good & euill of what woman you wilt.

And know thou yt 
if these fishes & all other thou may know the vertues & properties 
all by the booke of visuions of moneths. And so understand 
you by like thing in all other things.

Primum animal est Leo. Ista bestia est valde fortis &
The first beast is a Lyon [lion]. This beast is full strong in the 
breast & in the cheekes & he is of strong beholding  or lookeing 
so that when other beasts seeth him they be moued togither with 
dread. And the skyne of him is of such vertue that if it be 
put with other skynes it destroyeth them & maketh [them] bare. & 
who that taketh the biting toothe of him that is cleped 
dens caninus & putteth it in gold it is good to take away & 
to take alien things. And the same doth a woolues 

[141r]
tooth. & if thou maketh a purse of the heart of a lion full of 
blood musco & almea, & ligno aloes & thimiamate, & it were 
gadered upon whom thou wilt & thou maketh hote, know thou that in 
that houre he shall love thee much & doe thy bidding. And if thou 
inclepest with the blood of a goat the prince of deuills he shall be 
ready anon to do thy maundement. And so more kinga or he for whom 
thou dost. And the same I say of great women.

The second beast is Elephans that is an Elephant & he is full great & when 
he is risen of herd he lieth, & when he falleth of herd he riseth 
for that therto he hath not knees disposed well. And the boone of 
the teeth of him is said Ebur that is Evory [ivory]. And if it be put in 
lectuaries it comforteth the feeblenes of the heart as much as 
margarita or more. And the bloud of him with the liver 
comforteth much fasting.

The third beast is Ceruus that is an 
heart [hart] which liueth much, for that he reneweth as the moone or 
an Egle. Who that maketh suffumigacion of the hornes is chaseth 
away serpents, & by it self it chaseth away deuills.

The 4 beast is 
Catus, that is a Catt, & he seeth better by night then by day, & 
who that taketh of him & of an yrchin & of a reremouse & 
maketh of alcofol & alcofolizeth his eyne he seeth well 
by night & by day. And if thou puttest <--25v--> there the eyne of an asse thou 
might see whether the spiritts & deuills of the ayre go in.

The 5 beast is mustela, that is a wesill, this bringeth forth her 
issue at her moneth after Poets not after Philosophers. This helpeth 
much when he is brent, & the skinne of him is written for to cause 
loue betwixt tweyne.

The 6 beast is Talpa1 that is a wandwarp 
& dwelleth under the Earth & is likened to a mouse, with this 
beast thou may make to come tempests, pestilences, haules, & 
lightnings & comstacions & many euill things, if thou puttest 
him bare & naked upon the Earth & ouerturned, 
And with this thou may make discord & concord whom thou wilt, 
for he is a cursed beast for that he healeth a man of 
the fester when he is brent [burnt] & the powder ia incast.

  
  1. Mole.
  

And when 
thou wilt know the vertue of other beasts, do as it is said in libro visionum, 
upon which aske thou this of the lord of vision that is 
yt it appeare to the that thou askest, & couetest to know of a beast 
which thou wilt. 

This beast seeth not neither hath eyn. And know 
thou that the vision of months is upon all things that thou askest or 
would knowe. And God shallbe wth thee if of right thou axe. And 
know thou that heere is fulfilled the third wing. And now beginn 
we the fourth which is complement & fullfilling upon all the 
Elements.

[De quarta ala. The fourth wing.]

Dixit Salomon sicut corpus vivum &c. Salomon said as a quicke 
body middle or great is  not moued with three feete neither 
any foule lesse then with 2 wings, neither the world 

[141v]
is gouerned lesse then with 4 elements. So this booke may not neither ought to 
be lesse then with 4 wings which be said 4 vertues. Wherefore Raziel 
said that who that shall be filled with this booke shall be as one of the 
prophets & he shall understand all vertues of things & powers of them. 
And if he understandeth well he shall be a quicke spirit & if he with holdeth (?) 
& worketh he shall be as an Angell. And therefore he put in this book 
22 Elements of great vertue that is 22 letters or figures which the sons of Adae 
that is of Adam mought not excuse.

1. The first is Aleph א, that is A. 
This letter is three cornered & it signifieth life power & highnes & the principle 
or beginninge in all things. These putteth all things in their figures 
& in their principles.

2. The 2 is said beth ב, that is B, & it is full good 
in things which we desire in battayle & in plee, & euermore 
sheweth goodnes & profitt.

3. The third is said gimel ג, that is g. And it 
sheweth euill & greif & impediment in things.

4. The 4th is said deleth ד, 
that is d. this sheweth turbation & death of some man & harme to him.

5. The 5 is said he ה, that is h, & it sheweth 
price & honour & gladnes 
& it is full good in all thing.

6. The 6 is said vau ו, that is v, & it sheweth 
death, paine, & trauaile.

7. The 7 is said Zain ז, that is Z, & it sheweth 
penys & riches.

8. The 8 is said heth ח, that is h, & it signifieth 
long life & health. 

9. The 9 is said thes [Teth] ט that is t, & it 
signifieth wrath woodnes & greif.

10. The 10 is said Joth [Yod] י, that is 
i, & it signifieth good life & gladnes & all good beginninge.

11. The 11 is said Caph כ, it sheweth in very gladnes & 
trauaile without profit.

12. The 12 is said Lameth ל 
& it sheweth gladnes & honour & profit.

13. The 13 is said mem מ, that is m, & it sheweth greife & 
otherwhile dolor.

14. The 14 is said num [Nun] נ, that is n. 
It signifieth restoring of a freind & a visitation of him & profitt.

[15. The 15 is said Samech ס...]1

  
  1. Omitted.
  

16. The 16 is said ayn ע. 
It sheweth occasion or euill of a woman.

17. The 17 is said pe פ. It sheweth health.

18. The 18 is said fee פ that is f. & it sheweth bloud 
yshed [is shed] of good men & high.

19. The 19 is said Saday צ. It sheweth health. 

20. The 20 is said Coph ק It sheweth hid life.

21. The 21 is said Res ר, that is r 
& it sheweth a man that is fallen & is risen.

22. The 22 is said Thau ת, that is 
c. it sheweth greife & diminution.1

  
  1. Note there are two forms of Pe, and the Shin is missing.
  

Now we haue said of the 4 wings 
upon the 22 letters that be upon the lawes of the table written. 
And know thou that there be no moe but onely 22 letters which 
be the roote of Sem~ [Semiforas], for with them it is formed & it is caused & is 
made & with out them it may not be.  And some men seyne that 
Camalio found them, but it is not soth, but the Angell Raziell 
gaue them written to Adam in his booke that is said liber ignis. And 
with them all the booke of Sem~ written. And know eich man that 
readeth this booke that the Creator said to Raziel the names of Sem~ 
wherefore if thou canst transpose these 22 letters or figures as it 
beseemeth thou shalt attayne the great name of the Creator. And 
with it thou might do what thou wilt euermore with cleanes & 
with helpe of the Creator. Now we haue fulfilled this booke 
of the wing like to the angells that is Panthaseron Micracon Sandalon, 
for euerych of these hath 4 wings by mandement of the 
benigne angell, which the Creator sent to me that this book 
were better compounded & well ordeyned.

Heere endeth the second booke & beginneth the 
iii book of Thymiamatibus.

[142r]

Liber tertius.

  

  Cp. VRL 1300 37r; Halle 14-B-36 22v.
  

Dixit Angelus adæ fac thymiamata &c. The Angell said 
to Adam make thymiamata. Thimiamata be confections of good odours 
wth which thou shalt suffume & thou shalt please to Creacion & 
thou shalt attayne to what thou wilt by this. And they of which they be made 
be preciouse things which thou shalt find out of good odour & of good nature 
& of cleane things. And when thou shalt do it be thou cleane of without 
all filth. And then the Angell rested in that houre. And Adam remayned & 
did that he might. And this Salomon expounded & said, I marvaile 
why this is the booke  of Moysy, also for the Creator said to Moysy 
make thou Thymiamata & suffume thou in the hille1 when thou 
wilt speake with me. Wherefore Salomon said, that suffumigacions & 
sacrifice, & unction maketh to be opened the gates of the ayre & of 
the fire & the gates of all other heauens. And by suffumigacions 
a man may see heauenly things & priuities of the Creator. And 
eich man know that they thirleth [drill] the Earth, water, & the lownesses. 
And Salomon said as there be 7 heauens, & 7 starres, & 7 dayes in the 
weeke, of which euerich is distinct & is not likened to his euen. So 
know thou eich man that there be 7 suffumigations which wthholdeth wth 
them the vertue of the 7 starrs, & maketh apaid [K: glad] the spirits of the ayre 
And the Angells of heauens & deuills, of angells of the world. And 
therefore for a man yeldeth to them it that is theirs. Therefore they 
be pleased & apaide for the words which thou sayst, when thou prayest 
or sayst the names of them or the names of the Creator. And for this 
that thou dost when thou washest thee & for the gift that thou 
giuest to them when thou suffumest. And these things yeldeth them 
earthly & appearing to thee. And the spirituall & invisible that is 
that neither euill men, neither beasts mought see thee if thou dost 
strongly about thee & about whom thou dost.

  

  1. The hill: Mt. Sinai.
  

Thymiamata is made of 
many things & these be principall upon the 7 dayes of the weeke. And 
first say we [of] thymiamata of the Saturday for the starre of him is higher 
& the Angell of him is mighty in the Earth. 

The first Thymiama [sic]
of the Saturday ought to be of all good things & well smelling rootes as 
is Costus & herba thuris [=hog's fennel]. And that is Thymiama of good. And so I shall 
shew of all other as it beseemeth to good. And thymiama to other I shall 
say in an other place.

Thymiama of the Sunday is thure, mastix, muscus 
& other such. And all other good gummes & of good odor in all good. And by 
the contrary in euill.

Thymiama of the Munday is folium mirti, & 
lauri & leaues of good odor, & so understand thou in his contrary.

Thymiama of the Tuesday is Sandalus rubeus, niger & albus, & all such 
trees & eich tree of aloes & cipresse, & so understand thou of eich tree.

Thymiama of the Wednesday is made of all ryndes [*woods] as Cinamomo, cassia lignea 
& cortices [citri et] lauri & macis & so understand thou in other.

Thymiama of the 
Thursday is nux muscata, [ut] gariofili & citruli & the rynd of arangiarum 
siccarx & pulverizatarum that is the rynde of orenges dry &d pouderd & all 
other fruits of good odors.

Thymiamana [sic] of the Friday is maus [*flores] rosa viole 
& crocus and all other flowers of good odor.2

  

  2. OP1.44: To Saturn are appropriated for fumes all odoriferous roots, 
  as costus root, etc. and hog's fennel; to Jupiter, odoriferous fruits as 
  nutmeg, cloves; to Mars all odoriferous wood as sandalwood, cypress, lignum-balsam, 
  and lignum-aloes; to the Sun, all gums, as frankincense, mastic, benjamin, storax, labdanum [i.e. Cistus], 
  amber [i.e. ambergris], and Musk; to Venus, flowers as roses, violets, saffron, and such like; 
  to Mercury all peels of wood and fruit, as cinnamon, lignum cassia, mace, citron peel [i.e. lemon peel], 
  and bayberries, and whatsoever seeds are odoriferous; to the Moon the leaves of all vegetables, 
  as the leaf indum, the leaves of the myrtle, and bay-tree.
  

And in the contrary to the 
contrary put you all thymiamata stincking. And know thou that eich 
thymiama of good odor gathereth together his spirits after that is his nature 
& his colour & his strength. Thus I say for good, good, for better, better.

And Hermes said of thymiamatibus that thymiama Lune is cinamonum 
& lignum aloes & mastix & crocus & costus & macis & et mirtus. Wee 
putteth this that eich of the Planetts haue a part in it & all this may be 
Luna, good & well fortunate by good spices & sharpe.3

  

  3. OP1.44: But Hermes describes the most powerful fume to be, viz. that which is 
  compounded of the seven aromatics, according to the powers of the seven planets, 
  for it receives from Saturn, pepperwort; from Jupiter, nutmeg; from Mars, lignum-aloes; 
  from the Sun, mastic; from Venus, saffron; from Mercury, cinnamon; and from the Moon, the myrtle. 
  

[142v]

Although Salomon made distinction upon the days & planets of the 
spices with the which a man ought to make thymiamata. And he 
said that of Saturni is eich good roote in good, euill in euill. And of 
Jouis all fruite, & of Martis eich tree, & of Solis eich gumme. 
& of Veneris eich flower. And of Mercurii each rinde, & of Lune 
eich leafe. And thus understand you in all other. & eich odorifr 
herbe is of Veneris. And Raziel bade to Adam that he should 
make good thymiamata & therefore Hermes understood that 
eich thymiama is made of all good things, As of roote, tree, rinde, 
leafe, flower, fruite & gumm. And yett seeds be put in it, as 
bacre & cardamonum & wexe & put thou in it all good thing 
& preciouse. And sythen he said Thymiama completum.

And the 24 (?) 
is some thymiama grecum or of greekes by which heathen men were 
wont to suffume idols & yet to day churches & aulers [K: altars] be 
suffumed, And it is said Thymiama Jouis & in sothnes who that 
useth these thymiamatibus be he cleane & chast & of all good 
will to the Creator he shall profitt.

Dixit Salomon super 
suffumigia hermetis quod dur &c. Salomon said upon the 
suffumigations of Hermetis which be said beneth & they be 
7 manners with which be made sacrifices. Some be made & 
the first which giueth fastesth & giueth teithings to the 
Creator, & therefore they trust that they attayne that they 
desire & it is sothe.

The second is that they washen themself 
& clenseth & dwelleth cleane. And therefore they trow to attayn 
their petition & asking & it is sothe.

The 3 is that they do 
almes for god & for the holy angells of him.

The 4 is that they 
sleeth & casteth the blood in the fire.

The 5 is that they 
sleeth & brenneth all.

The 6 is that they pray much in houers 
ordayned 7 tymes in the day, & 3 in the night.

The 7 is to make 
fumigation with good things & well smellinge & euerych of 
these did this that he might attayne the sothnes of it that 
he axed & [so] he attayned it by the mandement of the Creator.

And know thou that fumigacion ouercometh in all. Sothely who that 
suffumeth better to the eye it proneth [? K: proveth] & with this the wise man 
excuseth all other. And wite thou that who that can well know 
the natures of fumigacions he migh neigh to thilke spirits wch he 
would inclepe after the nature of fumigacions. And euermore 
consider thou the nature of the spirit & of the fumigacion & the 
spirits be constrayned by their contrary & be comforted by  like 
things. Wherefore it is to witt that as a wise leche in giueing a 
medicine to a sick man remoueth the sickenes & in ledeth 
health. So fumigacion remoueth the contrary from the place if it be 
good. And with euill fumigacion be remoued good spirits & euill spirits 
also dreadeth for eich thing more loueth health then sicknes. 
And therefore it is said that Sulphur remoueth both good spirits 
& euill. And this is probation & pref [profit] after one way. And there [is] 
another way for lignum aloes gathereth together the spirits of 
ligni aloes & none other. And Sulphur chaseth them 

[143r]
away & this is very reason. And then I say that Sulphur gathereth 
together his proper spirits & none other & they be full stronge & 
penetrate & thicke & be not seuerd or departed so soone from 
a place. But and if a place were suffumed with Sulphur & then 
were washen with water & suffumed wth ligno aloes, it doth 
draw away the spirits of Sulphur & induceth or inledeth his 
owne.

And know thou that the spirit of Azet that is quickesilver 
& the spirit of Thuris be contrary although spirits yet with all 
the deuills entreth & thirleth rather then the spirit of Thuris 
wherefore euerich hath full great might. And if thou wilt 
out draw the spirits, yet suffume thou with thur & they shall 
go out. And so understand thou of all other spirits good & euill.

And Salomon said know thou that as a phisitian putteth in a man 
good pure oyntments & cleane, &  they thirleth the body of a man 
& heleth, So fumigacions thirleth the 4 Elemts & maketh 
to se & know heauenly things which were euermore hevenly 
& wch descendeth from heauens as be angells & spirits of the ayre & the 
souls of dead men & deuills of lownesses & winds & spelunks [i.e. caves] & 
of deepnesses & fantasies of desert places. Wherefore know thou 
that all spiritualls with right fumigacion shall obey to thee & 
shall come to the & they should do thy commandement.

And Hermes 
said that all things that was or is present or shall be knoweth that the 
ouer nature ioyned with the nether by ordinance of tyme 
& houre maketh one body & understanding & that he can 
understand & know thilke things wherof creatures haue to liue 
& themselfe to gouerne. Wherefore know thou that there be fumes 
that chaseth away spirits & other that sleeth [K: steyeth] them, & constreyneth 
[them] to come & other that quickeneth them & strengtheneth & giueth 
might. And so by the contrary is some that destroyeth them & 
taketh away their might. And this is the probacion of this for the fume 
of an herte chaseth them away & this he said upon serpents. 
And that chaseth them away is fumus am~ce [? K: amnecae] that is the fume of 
fecis of oyle. And that, that sleeth them is the spettell of a fasting 
man. And therefore he said that fumigacion is fullfilling of ayre 
which hath not body, nethles fume destroyeth things that haue 
body. And so fumigacion suffise it to us in all things beneath.

And Raziel said, know thou that as water washeth all uncleanesse 
And fire maketh liquid or molteth all mettalls & maketh clean 
& fineth. And as the ayre is the life of a liueing man  & the 
Earth sustayneth or beareth ech body & nourisheth ech plant: So 
understand thou that good Thymiama z. fumigacion is fullfilling 
in the worke to be the invocations of spirits, & of 
other things & well proporcioned with which Thymiama 
is confect or medled. And were made in eich houre convenient 
or accordinge.

Dixit Salomon propter hoc pono horam & tempus &c.

  

  Cp. VRL 1300 40r; Halle 14-B-36 24r.
  

 Salomon said for 
this I put the houre & the tyme in the worke ffor in all 
houre in which a man will speake to a king or to a prince, 
he may not speake to them, neither in eich houre in which 

[143v]
a Sonne axeth any thing of the father he giueth to him. Therefor 
it is darke to thee to chese the tyme & the houre upon these 
that they axert. 

This is qo tempus quidam that is sometymes said 
Jovis: be it done in the day of Jovis & of Veneris in the day of 
Veneris & of Martis in the day of Martis & of Saturni, in 
the day of Sabote [=Sabbath]. And so of other that be done in invocacion 
of spirits & in all praysings of Angells. And the fumigacion of 
Angells which is pure  & cleane. Know thou that it is a 
spirituall thing & liueing & fellowshiping to heauenly 
things. And now said Vealha. Know thou that no man ought 
to make fumigacion of preciouse things, but if he were clene 
& with cleane waters well washen & anoynted with precious 
oyntments which be made cleanly & with preciouse things 
& cera alba [=white wax], balsamo, crono, & musco, Abiba tyneca [K: abitatmeca], algalea [=civet]
ulmea, thure, mirra, oleo oliuarx [=olive oil]. 

  

  VRL 1300 40v:      "cera alba balsamus muscus ambra thÿrus algalea almea thus mirra & oleum oliuarum."
  Almost identical is Halle 14-B-36 25r: "cera alba balsamus muscus ambra thyrus algalea almea thus et mirra et oleum oliuarum."
  ("white wax, balsam, musk, ambergris, thyrus (?), civet, storax, frankincense, myrrh, and olive oil.")
  

And this oyntment be 
it well kept & well warded in a cleane  place. Of (?) him after 
that also the clothings be cleane white, new, & good not 
broken neither blacke. And then suffume he himself 
worshippfully & the manner of suffumeing him self ought 
to be made in 7 manners toward the East, the North, the 
West & the South toward heauen aboce & toward the 
Earth beneath, & the 7th tyme all aboute. And as oft as 
thou dost this euer more dresse1 thy mind unto god & pray that 
he fullfill thy will. And know thou that I found in some 
old booke that these were the more fumigacions. Thus 
thymiama graecum. mastix, laudalus, galbanum, muscha-lazarat, 
mirra, & ambra.  And these be collectors of 
spirits & placacions of them.

  
  1. dresse: direct or address.
  

And Solomon said when thou wilt 
gather together the spirits of the ayre do them in this manner.

Cleanse thou thy selfe in the better manner that thou 
canst & go to a pit where thou wilt knowen to thee & 
suffume it & inclepe him by his owne proper name & 
lath him or pray him & that by three nights. And if he 
appeareth send thou him to a certaine place or to an house 
or to a quadeirie that is a place there 4 wayes meett 
or to a yard or garden & suffume thou the pit toward 4 parts 
& in the place where thou lathest also as I have said & 
then know thou that he shall come & he shall appeare to 
thee that thou shalt do this.

Et dixit Hermes, quod spiritus quod apparent &c..

And hermes 
said that the spirits which appeareth in this world be these.

 
Some sothly be heavenly & the prophet clepeth them Angells 
& they be bright & cleare as flame or a starre as we 
hav said. Other be ayry or of the aiyre & so many colours 
greene, bright & other such & of many figures. And other 
be fuyry [=fiery] & they be bright & red. And other be watrie & 
they be white & as bright faire or iron burnished or quicksilver. 

[144r]
Other be that neigheth to men & be like to a 
white cloud or to a white cloath. And other be derke & dymme 
& of diverse formes which be said divells, which be hidd with 
the wind & they be in the deepnes of the sea & of lowness of 
spirits that bring with them haules & tempests & lightning. 
And wisemen clepeth them huge spirits & strong. Now we 
have said of the nature of spirits & putt to thy mind & thou 
shalt attayne with the helpe of God.

Dixit Raziel. Sicut in aere puro claro &c.

Raziel said. As in 
the pure, clere, & bright & cleane & peaceable ayre all things 
gladeth & ioyeth of it. So know thou that for cleannesse and 
fasting & washing of water & prayers and orison of the Creatour. 
And for naturall & cleane sufumigacon & very fayth or trust 
thou might please them which we hav said above. And 
Raziel said to Adam, know thou that in all maner the life 
of Angells is heele & cleane. And the suffumigium or suffumigacion 
is brede of spirits, which spirits liveth in fasting & cleanesse 
& charity, sacrifice with Orison be the houses of holy soules 
& trust is the auter [=author] of God [=good]. Wherefore eich man that hath these 
above said in himselfe he shall attayne or neigh & he shall 
profitt. 

And Solomon said, these be that befalleth in 
suffumigacion. Of suffumigacion anone shall come to us fumes 
& then odour & of the fume & cloud & of the cloud an high 
cloud & wind. And of the wind ascendeth the cloud higher & 
of the cloud an high wind, & of the wind ascendeth higher & 
is made a soule & of this the spirit is made higher. And 
of the spirit an Angell of heavens & of angells light & 
these be caused by cleane suffumigacions.

And know thou 
that suffumigacions be of 7 maners. Some sothly sharpe 
& other penetratit or persinge, other sweete smelling 
other stinkinge, other simple, other meeke, other of grife 
other sothly of peace. And everych of these maners is after 
his odour said & nature & complexion. Wherefore Hermes 
said that as coldnes congeleth water with his cold. And as 
water of the sea is congealed with great heat & as azerta cona 
congeleth the water of wells. And everych of these 
congeleth the water, one with coldnes & another with hotnes, 
another by arte, another by nature & the matter is made one 
body & one gobbett [=piece]. And know thou that good suffumiacon 
gathereth together & constrayneth & maketh spirits to appeare 
in the ayre & secrete or privy things & it maketh them to 
take a body which our eyne [=eyes] seeth. And Salomon said as the 
Adamant draweth yron [=iron] to him self, so know thou that suffumigacon 
gathereth together & draweth the spirits of the ayre 
& maketh them to come to the place where thou doeth it
& wold gather them together. And the wise men says suffumigacon
is like to the roote of arzolle for as it ioyneth together 

[144v]
gobbets of flesh into one. So suffumigacons gathereth together 
spirits of heavenly or heaven with the 4 Elements & they make 
that they taketh a body & spirits taketh visible bodies & 
palpable. And a body taken they fullfilleth that they be axed 
of them & that to likenes of a mirrour to which if there be 
sett before what figure thou wolt a like appeareth within. 

Thus fumigacion made cleanly & invocacion in the houre after 
the spirits proportionall. The spirits appeare to us & new operacions 
& workings with fullfillinge upon the thing which thou 
askest. And be thou never deceived in the knowledge of 
suffumigacions & put thou thy mind in them least they be 
transposed, & thou shalt fullfill as that were & after 
that thou doest as he said. And Salomon said I will touch 
some what to thee of the nature of suffumigacions. In 
colericke suffumigacions, who that useth it much, it 
maketh to see in sleepe, or in sothnes greene things & yelow 
& diverse colours. Melancholious fumigacion sheweth 
leady [=grayish] things. Sanguine fumigacions sheweth red things, & 
otherwhile it is sheweinge of purpure colour. Phlegmaticke 
fumigacion sheweth white things & faire and so understand 
thou after that the nature were & the appearing of 
spirits & of their colours & visions & the worke of them shall 
be after the sharpnes of it & the goodnes & direccion of 
fumigii, is fullfilling of the thing after that the ymage 
were firmed & the orison of the thing nempned & the 
trust for all is in the intention of the man and in the houre in 
which it is done.

Now we have said how every of the 
Planets hath his fumigacions. Now say we the fumigacions of 
the 12 signes & of the 36 faces of them. 

Aries holdeth by himself mirtam. 

Taurus costum, 

, masticen, 

 Musthalazerath, 

 thus, 

 Clastem, 

 galbanum,

 opopanec, 

 lignum aloes, 

 asafetidam,

 euforbium, 

 thymiama [=thyme].

[Incenses for each decan.]

The first face of Arietis holdeth mirtam, the 2 stamoneam, 
the 3 piper nigrum. 

The first of Tauri costum, the 2 cardamom, the 3 cassiam.

The 1 of Geminorum masticen, the 2 cinamomum, the 3 cipresenum.

The 1 of  mastum, the 2 succum, the 3 anisum.

The first of  thus, the 2 lignum balsami, the 3 nucem mustatam [=nutmeg].

The first of  sandalos, the 2 crocus, the 3 masticen. 

The first of  galbanum, the 2 befor, the 3 mirtum.

[ is missing.]

The 1 of  lignum aloes, 2 folia lauri, the 3 gariofilium.

The first of  Asam feti, the 2 Colofoniam, the 3 piper longum.

The first of   euforbeum, the 2 reubarbarum [=rhubarb], the 3 stamonea.

The 1 of  thymiama [=thyme], the 2 crocum, the 3 sandalus albus.

Nota secundum Hermetis de fumigiis.

And Hermes said , , & 
 withholdeth eich choleric 
spice & bitter, &  , 
& , melancholius & stipticke. 

[145r]
   
sanguine & sweet, 
  &  
phlegmatike & salt of 
savour.

And this Salomon holdeth for the more naturall for such 
spices we give & with them we suffume. And which maner fumigacion 
we give to the planetts, such we give to the dayes & houres.

  
As the Sonday the first houre is of Sola & all the day together, we should 
give thus, masticen, & mustum. As we have said of planets in the 
beginning of this booke of thymiamatum. And so understand thou of all 
other. 

[Incenses for the four seasons]

Know thou the suffumigacion to tymes. 

  

  VRL 1300 43v; Halle 14-B-36 26v.
  

In primo tempore lignum aloes, thus, & crocum. In the second tyme thymiama, costum, 
masticen. In the 3 tyme, sandalo, cassia, mertum. In the 4 time 
mustum, succum & lignum balsami. And he gave to eich of 
the 4 tymes their spices or kinds, so he giveth to eich month one 
spice in order.

[Incenses for the four cardinal directions]

Dicamus nunc suffumigia 4 partium mundi &c.

  

  VRL 1300 43v; Halle 14-B-36 26v. 
  

Say we now suffumigacions of the 4 parties of the world & of the 
4 Elements, for all things that be in this world be compounded of the 
elements or simples. Suffumigacions of the 4 parties of this world be 
these. Upon the party of the East & the fire serveth Ambra, 
Muscus & alba cera that is white waxe. Upon the party of the South 
& the Earth, algalia [=civet], almea [=storax], & tyriaca [=theriac].1 Upon the party of the 
West & the ayre, balsamus, Camphora & clarum olivanum [=olive oil]. Upon 
the North & the water lignum aloes, mux mustate, & macis.2

  

  1. VRL 1300 reads: tinata; Halle 14b36 reads: cinata. 
  I have not been able to identify a botanical with that name.
  Folger and Royal MS 17Axlii both read theriac.
  

  2. VRL 1300: lignum aloes, muc, & macis.
  

And Salomon said, eich man that wold do any thing by this booke 
put he the mind to the chapters of thymiamate that he 
know the kings & iustly can meddle them. And so know 
thou that thou might easily worke by hit & without travaile 
thou might fullfill all thing that thou desirest to set. Now 
we have fullfilled one Chapter of fumigiis or fumigacions & 
we will say furthermore hit upon which was our intention 
with the helpe of God.

[Liber temporum]

  

  VRL 1300 44r; Halle 14-B-36 27r.
  

Here beginneth the 4 booke that 
speaketh upon tymes of the yeare.

In nomine dei pii, Incipio scribere librum istum &c.

In 
the name of the meke god I begin to write this booke that 
is said Cephar Raziel, which the Angell Raziel gave to 
Adam & it shall speake upon the 4 tymes of the yeare & month 
& day with his night how we should nempne eich thing. And know 
eich man that this is said the booke of tymes, & the Angell gave 
it that is said mighty & great by the mandement of the Creator 
quicke God & in all things mighty. And for that Adam should 
know all things by hit which he would know in this world what 
it is, what it was, & what it shall be in all things. 12 months of 
the yeare & dayes & houres & that by order & similitude of 
cleane fasting & of washings of sacrifices of fumigacions 
made by 7 dayes ere the first mone [=Moon] were & ere the sunne 
should ascend his tale i.e. the ascendent. And ere the sunne should 
ascend upon his starre. Zedet i.e. Jovis. And they should be

[145v]

nempned in this booke by month, holy angells that have might 
upon the 7 heavens formed of fire & the beholding of them fire 
& the life of him is fire. And they seeme clothed with fire 
& they be covered with fire & from the fire went out, & in the 
fire they dwell & they be of great fellowships mighty upon 
the 12 months of the yeare by the precept of the Creator of it 
which said the world by hit, & all angells be & were before 
it. & there be 7 powers before that face of it, & to eich of them is 
given might & hath a day of the month & of the weeke. And of 
them some be standing in environ, & some be some be sytting in chaires 
with great honour serving to the Creator & they be ever 
more ready & bound to goe out & to entre to come & to go & with 
all good & evill, what ever is made & to enchaunte & to put 
downe & to cover privy things & to discover or to make revelasion.
And all this that we have said by the mandement of God. 
& all the more angells & lesse & the princes of them with 
their powers with their orders, or with their fellowships, they 
clepeth themselves everich with their names & which be Selly, 
i.e. high or soveraigne evermore they prayse God the Creator, 
which formed them. And allso all the powers of all heaven 
in the month & in the day in which he formed them. And they 
be all speaking to himself together as men. And Raziel 
said that these angells wrote these names & this booke, 
& he said that there be above 7 angells mighty upon 7 starres 
& these be 7 potestatesor powers mighty upon 7 days of the 
weeke & they be keepers of them & of the 24 houres of 
the day & of the 7 heavens & of the 12 signs & of all other 
things that governeth this world. And Raziel said to Adam 
behold, know, & withhold these 7 powers or potestates, which 
have power in the 7 heavens & the 7 stars. The names of 
which be these.

Sabaday, that is , 

Zedet that is , 

Madyn that is , 

Hamina that is , 

Noga i.e. , 

Cocab i.e. , 

Labana i.e. .

The names of the 7 heavens in which they be borne be these 
Samayn, Raquia, Saaquyn, Mahum, Maon, Zebal, Araboc.

Upon Samayn goeth ,
upon Raquia ,
& upon Araboc ,
& so understand thou of other. The names of Angells that 
have power upon the 7 starrs & goeth upon the 7 heavens 
& otherwhile in their chaires be these. Capziel, Satquiel, 
Samael, Raphael, <raphael,> [sic] Amael [*Anael], Michael, Gabriel. And the 
power of these is that Capziel is the power of Sabaday. Satquiel of 
Zedet & Samael of Madyn & Raphael of Hamina, Amael of 
Noga, Michael of Cocab, Gabriel of Labana. And everich of 
these sitteth in his heaven & the meynees [=their company or crew] of them all about. 
And they be of divers colours. <And they be of divers colours> as white, 
blacke, red, yellow, greene, ledy, pardi viati, medled over gilt 
& of the colour of a Peacocks feather & of many other colours.

These be the Angells that have power upon the 12 months 
of the yeare. The names of the months be these, of the yeare 

[146r]

Nysan, Yar, Zevan, tamus, Abelul, Tysiryn, Marquesnam, Quislep, 
Tobez, or Thebeth, Sabat, Adar, Post adar, Postmodo.

  

  i.e. Nisan, Iyar, Sivan, Tammuz, Av, Elul, Tishrei, Marcheshvan, Kislev, Tevet, Shevat, Adar, and 
on leap years, Adar II.
  

The names 
of Potestates be these & they be 12 capitalls, that is one upon 
euerich month of Lune, & the rather is Oriel, Sasuyel, 
Amariel, Noriel, Beraquiel, Maguynya, Scufriel, Barsiel, Adoniel, 
Anael, Gabriel, Romiel, Laciel. And euerich of these hath 
so many potestates, helpers, more or greater as there be days 
in the month or many other seruants of them. And with the 
aforesaid Angells a man may know all thing that is to come 
in euery day & euery houre with the proper signs of them who 
that knoweth them well. If he woll know of many 
Reynes or few or when they shall be or if they shall be or no 
& the day & houre when they shall falle. And a man 
may know by them which is his signe & his starre. And he may 
know of his life if it shall be long doinge or of short in the 
world & other things either for a sick man or an hoole [=hail i.e. healthy] either 
for a man or for a woman. Or he may know a sutill understanding 
or sharpe. he may know what is to come & to do with 
it that he woll. And the dayes of the yeare or of solis, alone 
in which may be done the working of this booke by 365 & the 
4 part of one day in the worke of dayes. The yeares of lune be 
otherwhile 360 dayes or 4 houres & 46 minutes after the yeare 
of lune. And the fullfilling of tymes is this. In one tyme be 
3 months, & when the tymes be 4 Sothly til to 12. And knowe 
thou that Nizan that is the first month entreth in the first day 
of the first moone wheneuer were Luna prima of the month 
of Martii, & so of other. And the first very tyme is from the first 
point in which the  entreth into Arietem till it enter the 
first point of Cancri [=Cancer], & the 2 from  into 
am & the 3 from 
 into  & the 4 from 
 into Arietem, & this is the better distinction 
of tymes. And in the hour in wch Raziel gaue the booke 
to Adam Of tymes, & months, & names of things then was 
adam conforted only when in thilke day fillen lightnings 
moued & thunders & coriscations appreariden & there was in that 
day great tempest in all the world, both in the land, & in the ayre 
& in the sea. And in the houre in which the Angell Raziel 
opened this booke & gave it to Adam, then he gaue to him 
might & strength & suretie in all the wordes of this booke 
& miracules that be in it. And when this booke fell before 
the face of Adam. Then Adam dread full much & quoke of 
great dred, & fill downe into the earth as though he had bin 
dead. Then the Angel Raziel said to Adam rise & be thou 
comforted, for know thou that a very soth fast spirit hath 
descended in thé in the high heauens which hath lightend thee 
& hath put in this houre in thee knoweing &d might & that 
thou shallt attayne yt thou shalt axe. And I say to thee that 
thou consider in this booke & beholde in it, & by it thou shalt 
know & understand what euer was & that is & that shall be after 
thee. And in that houre in wch this booke was giuen to Adam 
fire fell upon the brincke of the flode of paradise & the Angell 

[146v]
ascended by the flame of the fire to heauen. And an Angell 
descended in similitude of a cloud white & spake with him 
playnely, And come to him as a man well bright &d cleare 
like to the clearenes of a starre in his body &d full of many 
other all about & in ascending when he was seuered. Euermore 
Adam was like to a lambe which formed well bright as the 
flame of fire & clearer then the fire of a furnice in wch gold 
is purged. And then Adam saw this & found & knew that 
of the Lord of all worlds which is a great king & mighty in all 
things. This booke was sent for he. And then he considered 
or looked in it with holynes & cleanes. And then he beheld in 
it all thing that he would know in this world. And this was 
the first word Adam had with the Angell Raziel. And [er]go 
he considered in it & gouerned him self by it. Salomon said upon 
the aforesaid reason aboue after that the Angell Raziell said 
to Adam that it behoueth know the tymes & the month & 
the day. It behoueth us furthermore to seeke one houre 
before another and one tyme before another, for who that 
soweth wheat in Ver [=Spring] it may mot be gathered in the same 
Ver, & this is after the Temperament of the party of the 
northe. & [er]go it is necessary or needfull to deuid the yeare 
into 4 parts & a month into 4 partes, & an houre into 4. And if thou 
keepest these diuisions & understandest thou shalt profitt in 
all it that thou wolt, for this that all naturall thing is made 
in the tyme & in the day & in the houre according as the higher 
or soueraingne Creator ordeyned. Raziel said if thou wilt 
know any thing of this world that is of other that be in 
heauen or heauens which be fellowshipped with the first hevens. 
Or if thou wilt do any thing that be fullfilled to thy will, 
clense thou thy body by 7 dayes that is washe thee, & sate thou 
not a thing of theft, neither of rauen, neither of euill party 
nor a thing uncleane, neither that is fallen to death, nor a 
beast of 4 feete, nor other, & eschew thou thee from malice 
& falsnes. And thou shalt not drinke wine nor 
neither thou shalt eate fether [K: fishes] or any thing of 
which bloud goeth out. And ioyne thou thee not to a

In the first tyme it is said Haham, & his Angiel is Satuyel, in 
the 2 Cypaon, & his angell is Jacyel, In the 3 aeresac & his 
angell is ababact, in the 4 aycyhambabo, & his angell is Caanyel.

These be the names of the 4 parties of the world. In the 4
tymes.

In the first tyme the East is said Acbedan, in the 
2 Cadrenac, in the 3 Abriel, in the 4 Acritael.

These be the names of the North part in the 4 tymes: In the 
first tyme it is said Hemnyna, in the 2 abdich, In the 3 galgadar, 
in the 4 rabbysor.

These be the names of the west part. In 
the first tyme Mahanahym, in the 2 Sitgor, in the third Zarzyr, in 
the 4 Rabyur.

These be the names of the south part. In 
the 1 tyme Mansor, in the 2 Alparon, in the 3 Machuyel, 
in the 4 Thamny.

These be the names of Angells in the 4 
parts of the world. In the parte of the East these haue might 
or power: guabriel, raphael, Uryel, in the part of the North 
these: Adryel, yamyel, Zabdyel. And in the parte of the West 
these: Adtryel, Samael, Joel.  And in the parte of the South these: 
Cocabyel, Saryel, Mychael.

And name thou them upon all 
things that thou dost in the 4 parts of the world & thou 
shalt profitt.

Names of the Planets proper in 4 tymes.

Ista sunt nomina 7 stellarum qui sunt & vadunt &c.

These be the names of the 7 Stares that be & goeth in the 7 
heauens euerich by himselfe: Sabaday, Zedet, Madyn, 
Hamyna, Noga, Cocab, Labana. And euerrich of these 
hath his owne proper name upon the 4 times of the yeare 
as we shall say in this Chapter beneth. And Salomon said 
in explanation of this place. Wherefore euerich planet & 
euerich thinge before said changeth his name in eich tyme 
for his thinge, for heere standeth some tree & from thilke 
tree cometh to us 4 things, & of these 4 things, the 1 is 
when it buryoneth, the 2 is the flower, the 3 is the fruite, the 
4 is the seed, when it is in it. Ergo the Sunne is said in the first time 
hott & moist, in the 2 hot & dry, in the 3 Cold & dry, in the 4 Colde & 
moist. These be the workings of the Sunne &d the properties of 
it upon all things. And for a other reason the names of things 
aboue said be changed in 4 parts of the yeare, ffor euerich 
tyme hath his Nature & his complexion in himselfe as 

[151r]

we have said of water which is in the first tyme temperate 
And in the 2 hotte & in the 3 rotten & in the 4 congeled. 
And so other things of the world euerich by himself. 

To ensample why Raziel put his name to eich thing. In each 
thing be the 4 lords that haue might in eich thing & euerych 
in his tyme. And it is said that there be 4 Elements whereof 
one is fire, which hath might in the first tyme & so other. Wherefore 
know thou that euerich thing changeth his name as first 
we say a man: a child. And then a youngling, & then a middle 
man, & the 4th tyme an old man. And so things chaungeth 
their names who will clepe them a leader & this is in a man.
And so understand thou of Mettall, & in all things that wexeth 
& liueth. 

And Salomon said & all other that it was more iust [=just] that 
eich thing should haue 7 names then 4, for that all they 
might descend of 4 bodise, & to them is giuen all the might.
Sothely they put 4 names to euery thing that it were more easy 
to worke. These 4 names be assigned upon the city of dauid my 
ffather & myne, which had many names. Sothly Isaac the wiseman 
said that the first name was Remusale. And then 
Jebuysalem, Jeroboam, Jerusalem. And these names this 
Cyty receiued for 4 Lords that were in it, for euerich put 
to his proper name  & for this like things of this world receiueth 
4 names in themself or 7 or more after that god hath ordeyned. 
And ergo no man marvaile of these names of things in 4 times. 

In 
the higher heauen that is the first from the ouer partie & it 
is the 7 from the neather in hit serueth Sabaday. And his 
angell Capcyel. 

In the first tyme Sabaday is said Cuernes.

In the 4th Affryquyn. And know thou that thou shalt name the names 
of the starrs & of her Angells with their names in their 4 
tymes & thou shalt profit when thou shalt know anything 
of them.

Here beginneth the 5 booke
that treateth of cleanesse.

Dixit Salomon revelatum fuit mihi de isto libro &c. 

Salomon said It was shewed to me of this booke of Raziel & of 
many angells after that I had this booke & of these 
wch norished powers & vertues & matter & stength of 
ye 7 potestates aboue & that by the mandement [mandment: commandment] & 
obedience of the Creator or maker of the world. And they 
said thus. Salomon thou hast axed witte & wisedome 
& fairenes & might in will complete & nempned full 
great for euermore upon Earths. And know thou that 
all kings & lesse men that should come after thee & wch 
should here speake of thee, shall loue thee, & worship thee 
& should set price of thee & shall prayse thee & keep thou 
this booke & worke thou with it with reuerence and 
cleannesse. And Salomon said to the benigne Angell 
Natanael, which hath might in the ayre, And this evermore 
was fellowshipped to Salomon. / which be thilke 7 
bodies which be seene aboue bright, faire, cleane & cleare, 
wch ceaseth neuer to go, neither the wayes of them be void 
& they faileth neuer, but euermore dureth goynge their 
wayes. And it that taryeth more in going his way fulfilleth 
it in 30 yeares. And then they appeare such as they were 
before & which went before thus they sawe. And thus it is 
said that they should be how long god would. And thus 
I say of an 100 yeares & a 1000 that they neuer be 
changed neither in quantity nor in colour, nor in might 
nor in moveing, but we haue found them as the prophetts 
& other old men founden. An[d] the angell Natanael 
said to Salomon, the 7 bright bodies which thou seest 
aboue be put beneath & they in going upward holdeth in 
ballance or in rule the 4 elemts beneath. And therfore 
the moueing of them cesseth not for such might the 
Creator gaue to them. And know thou that the matter of 
them is simple & pure without corruption & euermore 
durable. And the state of them is likened to the Lord 
that formed them, although they obey to him in all 
things. And Natanael said to Solomon know thou 
that in the heauens of these 7 bright bodies be angells 

[152r]
without number mighty in all things. And everiche of them hath his 
proper mighte & his strength & vertue. And they be unlike among 
themself as men together or other beasts. & eueriche serueth of 
his office to the Creator that formed them or made them. 
And Salomon said to Nathanael wch is the life or the might or 
the seruice that these angells doth. And Nathanaell said the 
life of them is of cleannesse of Oryson, & of trustines & the 
might of them is of suffumigii, holocausti & sacraficii. And the 
seruice of them is, that when the Creator woll they go from place 
to place when any cleane man hath prayed [to] the Creator as it 
beseemeth. And then they do good or Euill as the Creator woll 
for in them is power, scyence & will complete. And Salomon said 
which be these 7 bright bodies & how be they named. And of 
what things serueth euerich. And Nathanael said that same 
that Raziel said to Adam. The higher of these that goeth 
slower is said Sabaday. And all the Remes of his heauen be 
full of yse [ice], snow, & haile, & wrath, rancor, & coldnes, & all the 
Angells that be there clothed with darknes full derke & the 
greatnes of them be full high & full long & small & upon the 
Earthes & upon deuills & upon darknesses & coldnesses & dryness. 
And this hath power upon winds of this nature & they have 
power of doing good & euill & the Angell of it is Boel 
crowned upon all other.

In the second heauen 
standeth Zedet [Zedek] and all the Remes of hym.

Dixit Salomon Rex filius Regis Dauid &c.
Salomon the king the Sunn of Dauid the king said, that was king 
of Jerusalem, of Surye & Damaske of Egypt, Lord of 
Babylony, Prince of Scyences, couetouse of Cleanesses, 
ensercher of Priuities, keeper of good true men, auvyder 
of leasing of poore men, of vertues desirer upon l~re vertues 
& spedefullnesses of words busyly thinking, & most 
suttily [subtily] in minde enserchinge. I have enquired & knowne that in 
words is power, vertue, & effect & of all humour hool [whole] & health 
& there may be sufficient fulfillinge. And he said I see that 
the most fame is of wise men & prophetes by words & bookes 
which they haue lest into testimony of them. And I see that 
the sonns of Adam, & of Hermes & of Noe [=Noah] & their sonns & many 
of other prophets haue left bookes by their death by which they 
should claryfy their fame, & anentes men glory should remayne. 
And I see that my father king David compowned or made 
some booke in which bee contayned all orysons which he might 
knowe & find, which sothely latin men that is Romayns clepeth 
the saut' [psalter]. Which sith it is of prayers alone & of holy names 
of the Creator it is named the head of Orisons. In the same 
booke king Dauid wrote all things what euer he might 
knowe of Patriarkes & old wise men to the praysing of the Creatour. 
I sothly king Salomon long studying in holy words 

[152v]
which vertues & miracles I found to be, while there is 
fullfilled in eich working trust & will. And I saw the books 
in which while I studied long I know Adam & hermes & 
Noe [=Noah] & Moyses & many other most wise men, I know 
of great privitees & the vertues of his books.

Cum ergo veteres & antiquos Sapientes &c. When go [therefore] I understode 
old wise men to haue made books how or with what witt or 
with what art I might know the sciences of all the foresaid 
I enquired. And there answered some old man of good minde 
& understanding which was cleped Zebraymayl. And the 
king said Adam had a maker & Mr that is to wite or Lord 
maker & Gabriel to Mr. ffurthermore Hermes the 
discreete & most wise man & Moyses had a Mr & a freind 
that is to wit Crotum. Aaron sothly had a freind of 
which go [therefore] is made resistence that a wise man may not be 
without a Mr. how arrettest yu tho to [thou too] mow [may] be wise wth out 
Mr But that thou be wise, these I know to be necessary 
to thee. A wise Mr & discreete, longe, & continuall study 
many olde bookes of great wise men made, oft & ofter ouer 
red perfitt & amended, glad & continuall health of thy 
body, long life without cures [cares?] & trauayles quiete. 

Salomon said to the wise man, is not this possible to be done 
by a sharter way then that thou hast said aboue. Zebraymayl 
answered, king, by a lighter & shorter way then 
this ne unknow thou not to mowe be done. To whom 
Salomon [said,] how therefore. To whom the wise man [replied,] open thou 
privily & fully the arke of the Testament noman knowing 
or understanding. In which all secrets or priuitees & old 
wisdomes & words of great power & of vertue thou shalt 
find. By which not only thou shalt know things a passed but 
those that be present and those that be to come. Salomon 
answered, for this that thou hast answered to me I giue 
thancks to that high & blessed Creator which reigneth wthout 
beginning & liueth without end wch after yt it pleased to him 
all things with word alone he formed or made & there is 
not any more noble or mightier then he wthout whom no 
vertue or power is which giueth wisedome to wise men, 
he is that is of all things the first, syth he is wthout beginning 
of all things the last, sith there is none end of him, 
this is of all things maker of none y made of whom the 
Reme or reigning is & shallbe of whom all works be good 
And of whom the will ouer all is free sith there is none 
that may againe say to him. 

Salomon trowinge 

[153r]
or trustinge to Zebraymayl made the arke of the testamony [testament] to 
be brought before him. And he sought all the books of Moysy [=Moses] & 
of Aaron, of Adam, & Noe [=Noah], & of their sons & of hermes & of other 
prophets, & all other which he might find of the miracles of Words 
& the vertues of them. And he sought all the old idolls of heathen 
men & Images of divers tongs hauing writeings & all things 
grauen which might be founde by all parts of the world he 
made in his palace to be gathered together. And he brought 
forth Mrs of euerych of the 72 on which should expownd to him 
privy letters or hid y. c. in ebrue [Hebrew], Caldey, Cyriac [Syriac,] greeke written. 
And to him they should expowne that were hidde. And when the 
letters were expownded he saw the nure parte to accord with it 
in vertues of wordes.

Rex ergo Salomon fecit archam nocte quadam apperiri &c.
Therefore [King] Salomon made the arke some night to be 
opened, that in the arke with reasons afterward we should be 
learned. Salomon said after that the soueraigne & the allmighty 
Creator had infused the grace of his spirit in me. I opened 
the arke of the Testament in which I found all 

things which 
long and studiously I had sought, Among which I found the 
booke which is cleped1 Raziel which the Creator sent to 
Adam by the angell Raziel when upon the brincks of the floud 
of paradise weepinge the creator he prayed & of him forgiunes 
of his sinnes he besought. And I found the booke which the 
Creator gaue to Moyses in the hill, when he made him 
partnes of his priuites in which 3 books, that is 3 reasons2 I 
found.

  
  1. Cleped: named.

  2. K: Orisons.
  

The first the prophets clepeth Semiphoras which 
the Creator gaue to Adam in paradise. The 2 booke is wch 
the Creator gaue to Adam in paradice in the houre of necessity or 
neede. The 3 is wch the Creator gaue to Moyses in the hall [sic hill] of 
Sinay after that he had fullfilled the fasting. & Salomon said 
I found in the Arke a pott full of Manna & the yard1 of 
Moyses wch was changed into a Serpent, & eft from a serpent into 
a yard. And the Tables of the Lawe & gobbetts of the first letters 
which Moyses wrought* for the synne of the people brake. In 
the ground sothly 3 of the Arke I founde some golden tables 
quadrate or 4 cornered in which were 15 preciouse stones 12 
tribes or lynages of Israel by similitude likened, & in euerich 
stone were written the holy high names of the Creator of the booke 
Semyforas [Semiphoras] outdrawen. And I found sund (?) boxe of marble haueing 
greene colour as Jaspis coloured. 

And in this boxe were 7 figures 
& in eich figure 7 great & vertuous names of the Creator to Moyses 
told. And other 7 which the Creator taught Adam in paradise. And 
this is a secret or privity wch much leyned (? K: leaned) & couered ought worlly [K: worshipfully] to 
be kept. I founde also about the extremities of the Arke 24 
rings with names & figures of the Creator written Semiforas with 
diuers colours written or figured. I my self Salomon haue minde  

[153v]
to haue had one of thilke rings in which I know to haue 
found such vertue when I said make to rayne, it 
reigned, whan I said est of thou hast made to rayne, so 
make thilke rayne to cease, it ceased. And beside Jerusalem 
the same reme aswell of tempests as of raynes 
it did or made. And Salomon said I found Semoforas 
with wch Moyses made the plagues in Egypt with 
wch he dryed the red Sea, wth wch he drew out water of 
the stone, wth wch he knew all the cleanesses of his people 
with which he ouercame princes & kings & mighty men 
wth wch what euer he would do he did. And that he wold 
destroy he destroyed, wth wch what euer els good or of euil 
he would he fullfilled at his owne will.

  
  1. yard: staff.

  *. In margin: wroth.

  3. sothly: truly.
  

Capitulum Explanationis istius nominis Semoforas &c 
The Capliter [chapter] of Explanation of this name Semiforum &c. it is 
that angells & deuells & windes & men as well quicke as 
dead. And all spiritts & all bodies dredeth Semiforas sothly 
is said the first secret or priuily, & great old & muchy 
leyned & hid of great vertue & power to gett what 
euer he woud. Semiforas is a word which ought not 
to be shewed to all men meither by hit but with great 
necessity or anguish ought any man to worke. And then 
with dread of the Creator he ought cleanly & meekely & 
deuoutly to name it.Also Semiforas is roote & begining & 
fundament of Orison, ensample of good life, trust of 
mans body the Orison or prayer of a iust man the Creator 
dreadinge. Salomon said aboue Sem~ [Semiforas] these be necessary wth 
meeknes fastinge, wth Orison, trust, wth charity, cleanesse 
with patience meekenes & constance of a man wth not wch 
you might worke nothing with wch what euer thou 
wolt thou shalt get when all vertues in workinge 
by Sem~ ought to be, netheles these 7 that in meekenes 
truelly, pacience abstinence, trust, charity, mercy ought in 
him principally to be had or to abounde.

Si ergo per Semiphoras operaris volumus vz quod sumus &c. 
If ergo [therefore] wee wod worke by Semiphoras It behoueth that we be 
bright or cleane of body & in trust stedfast & from 
falsnes & leasing1 fully departed. It behoueth also to 
dread the Creator & the creatures of him. Among wch 
we ought to dread most the Sunne wch giueth to us 

[154r]

light & derknes cold & heat wch is cause of changing of 
tymes & of temperance of the ayre & of herbs. We ought 
also to know the beholdinge (?) of the mone & the month wch 
5 by hit 12 & 5, 13 be accompted as is said Nyssan yar tina~ &c.2 
And we ought to know the waxeing 

& decreasinge of the 
moone when by it all creatures as the Sea, floudes & wells, 
& all the neather bodies waxinge & decreasing taken & bloode 
in the veynes & marrow in the head & in the bones after that 
the moone taketh waxeinge & decreasing they be norished in thilke 
also fusion and [in marg: Mercury] or molting of mettalls ne doubt thou not the 
vertue of the moone to worke. We ought also to know Sabaday 
i. Saturnum, by whom hunger & derth & all anguish in londs 
befalleth. We ought also to know & dread Zedet [Zedek] i. Jouem [Jupiter], by whom 
honour & health, & righteousnes & all good is had. We should 
also know & dread Madyn i. Martem [Mars], of whom colours & strifes 
& hate & battayles & leasing & all euills cometh. We ought also 
to know & dread hamina i. Solem [the Sun], by whom we haue light and 
darknes clearnes, by whom tymes as euill unto good & good into euill 
be transmuted or chaunged. We ought also to know & dread Nogam 
i. Venerem [Venus], by whom we haue meat & drinke & all necessarys 
or things that be needfull, by whom peace & loue & dilection 
among men is made fast & stable. We ought also to know & 
dread Cocab i.e. Mercur [Mercury], for he is nigher to us than all untake 
the Moone by whom merchandiss & vendisions or sellings & all 
secular things be exercised. Therefore behold you tho that be 
said & most the Spirits aboue said & thus thou shalt profitt 
& what euer thou shalt axe of the Creator rightfully 
thou shalt haue.

  

  1. leasing: lying.
  

  2. Hebrew month names are Nisan, Iyar, Sivan, Tammuz, Av, Elul, Tishri, Cheshvan, Kislev, Tevet,Shvat, and Adar. 
  

Heere beginneth the 6. booke that

dixit Salomon omnes co[mmun]iter horas & malas &c. 

Salomon said all men commonly good houres & euill & good dayes 
& euill good signes & euill to be they affirmeth & this with many 
reasons they confirmeth. And I my self Salomon, haue proued 
the dayes & houres of Madyn [Mars] & Sabaday [Saturn] which I foiund full grevouse 
for to worke. I haue proued also the hours of Zedet & Noga. 
And I saw that what euer I would worke of them lightlie I 
wrought. The hours of Cocab & Labana otherwhile be greuous 
otherwhile good I haue proued to be. And I saw that in the day & in 
the houre co~ia, nothing of my will I might fullfill. And know 
that the spirits aboue said anentis diuers men diuersly be named. 
Ffor the first in Ebrue, Sabaday in arabicke Zoal, in greeke or grice 
fenes, in Latin Saturnus is cleped or nempned. I say therefore 
that the first houre of the day of Sabaday, is said Sabaday. the 2 
Zedet, the 3 Madyn, the 4 hamina, the 5 Noga, the 6 Cocab, the 7 
Labana & the hiures of the night ought to be named to thee. 
And know thou that by the starrs abousaid & dayes & houres 

[154v]
what euer thou wilt thou shalt understand & thou shalt know 
the hid & privie wills of men.

Cumque per Semofor operaris voluent &c.  When he would 
worke by Semiforum first ere he beginn any thinge it 
behoueth him to name the 7 names of angells, for some angells 
be upon the 7 heauens. And upon the 7 planets & upon the 7 days 
of the weeke & upon the 7 mettalls & upon the 7 colours. And 
upon the 7 words haueinge power. The names of which be 
these Raphael, gabriel, Samael, Michael, Saq'el, Anael,
